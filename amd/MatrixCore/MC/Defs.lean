/-! # Matrix-core feature parameters

An MFMA instruction computes `D = AB + C`; every element is the inner product of Eq. (1),
`d = Σ_{ℓ=1}^{k} a_ℓ b_ℓ + c = Σ_{ℓ=1}^{k} p_ℓ + c`, evaluated in blocks of `N_FMA` products.
A `Profile` records the numerical features of one block, following the rows of the paper's
feature comparison table:

* input formats of `a` and `b` (`c` and `d` are binary32);
* `N_FMA`, the number of products in one multi-term addition;
* product alignment `(2, 23 + n_eab)`: integer and fractional bits kept after alignment;
* `e_{c=0}`: the exponent given to `c = 0`;
* late addition of `c`, and `align(c, S_{p_i,sum}) = (24, 32, RD)`;
* output rounding (RNE on every CDNA path);
* `|p_i|` overflow at `2^128`;
* subnormal support in input and output.

The accumulation itself is one of the four architectural configurations of the paper's
generalised model. -/
