# Executable Lean tests

The production library is under `TensorCore/`. Maintained regression witnesses are in the separate `TensorCoreTests` library under this directory. Worked calculations and batch IO adapters live in `examples/`; compiled batch entry points live in `Main/`. All use the parent project's pinned Lean toolchain.

Run commands below from the repository root unless a command explicitly enters `floatlib-port/`.

## 1. Build the imports

```sh
lake build
```

This builds `TensorCore`, `TensorCoreTests`, and five native adapters. `lake build TensorCore` builds production alone; `lake build TensorCoreTests` also builds the regression imports. Tests are included in the default validation build, while `import TensorCore` has no test dependencies.

The regression root is [TensorCoreTests.lean](TensorCoreTests.lean). It imports every maintained test module, allowing the trust audit to see the complete environment.

## 2. Run a worked calculation and its assertions

```sh
lake env lean examples/GettingStarted.lean
```

The file contains encoded inputs, `#eval` observations, concrete `example` assertions, and a symbolic application of a universal recovery theorem. It prints:

```text
Except.ok 1082130432
Except.ok 1065353216
Except.ok (some 1065353218)
```

The integers are FP32 encodings of four, one, and `1 + 2^-22`. The second calculation loses four tiny products in the TC model; the third uses scalar EFT to recover their contribution before final nearest-even rounding.

The assertions compare complete words and, for EFT, the branch constructor. `decide +kernel` constructs the proof through Lean's kernel reduction. If a computed word differs from the asserted word, Lean reports an error and the command exits unsuccessfully. The symbolic example checks a proof for arbitrary inputs satisfying its premises.

`#eval` executes code and prints a value; it does not assert that value is correct. `#check` displays a term's type and verifies that it exists; it does not run a numerical test. The proof assertions are what make the worked calculation a checked regression.

For the non-monotonicity witness:

```sh
lake env lean examples/NonMonotonicity.lean
```

The first two outputs are `1065353216` and `1065353217`: decreasing the accumulator from one to its predecessor raises the TC model output by one FP32 step. The next two outputs are both `some 1065353218`, from EFT correction. The file then prints the general K/p and j-range theorem types. [The non-monotonicity chapter](../docs/guide/03-non-monotonicity.md) explains the changing alignment grid.

## 3. Check an individual regression module

```sh
lake env lean tests/TensorCoreTests/TC/Monotonicity.lean
lake env lean tests/TensorCoreTests/EFT/EFT.lean
lake env lean tests/TensorCoreTests/EFT/NativeEFT.lean
```

A successful module may print nothing. Lean has still elaborated and checked its definitions and proofs. These files are mathematical regression modules; they do not each define an IO `main`.

The test root also includes binary rounding, canonical-format, public-domain, directed-rounding, and flowback modules. The [theorem index](../TensorCore/THEOREMS.md) links the general production results that these witnesses exercise.

## 4. Understand a Lean IO adapter

Checking `lake env lean FILE` does not call `main`. To execute `main`, use `lake env lean --run FILE INPUT` or a compiled executable.

[examples/EFTCoverage.lean](../examples/EFTCoverage.lean) reads a batch file, parses encoded operands, evaluates the model and scalar correction, and writes one JSON observation per row. The coverage harness creates that input:

```sh
python3 scripts/check_eft_coverage.py
```

Its path is:

```text
Python case generator / recorded vectors
  -> encoded batch file
  -> lake env lean --run examples/EFTCoverage.lean INPUT
  -> main parses operands and evaluates the Lean definitions
  -> JSON observations with bits, components, and predicate decisions
  -> Python exact-arithmetic expectations and assertions
```

Rational diagnostics use `numerator/denominator` strings. Python parses them with `fractions.Fraction` and compares them exactly. Words are integers, so a one-bit difference or signed-zero difference remains visible. The harness checks process success and record counts before accepting comparisons.

[examples/InstructionGroups.lean](../examples/InstructionGroups.lean) is another IO adapter. `python3 scripts/check_instruction_groups.py` generates 99 encoded cases and compares the Lean instruction outputs with an independent exact-arithmetic oracle applied in group order. The cases cover all 16 positions, populated groups, reversed group order, signed zeros, subnormals, and cancellation. This check runs entirely in software.

## 5. Run a compiled Lean executable

The paper adapter accepts text commands. Create a file with this line:

```text
block fp16 4 0 none 3072 3072 3072 3072 3072 3072 3072 3072 1065353216 1065353216
```

Run:

```sh
.lake/build/bin/tc_eft_paper /path/to/input.txt
```

The eight operand words encode four `2^-12 · 2^-12` products. The final two words are C and supplied D, both one. The JSON's `model.bits` is `1065353216`; `correction.bits` is `1065353218`, with branch `scalar`. The executable also prints exact ideal and extraction diagnostics.

| Executable | Input and purpose |
| --- | --- |
| `tc_trace` | V100 FP16 hexadecimal words, or `--file`/`--round-file` batches; full trace observations |
| `tc_features` | Decimal commands for formats, profiles, generic groups, and rounding |
| `tc_eft_paper` | Generic FP16/BF16/packed-TF32 block, rounding, and perturbation-family commands |
| `tc_bounded_eft` | Named profile blocks and fixed-workspace rounding; bounded/native scalar execution |
| `tc_lean_eft_check` | JSON Lines on stdin; compares bounded and native scalar execution paths |

For the last adapter, one request is:

```json
{"acc":0,"terms":[1065353216]}
```

It adds the encoded FP32 word for one to zero. The result is:

```json
{"reference":1065353216,"native":1065353216}
```

The [executable reference](../docs/reference.md) specifies word widths, profile names, packed/register TF32 conventions, and command formats. Lean checks proofs during elaboration; compiled execution evaluates the functions with proofs erased. Numerical comparisons additionally check the compiled path.

## 6. Run independent comparisons and trust audits

```sh
python3 scripts/validate.py
python3 scripts/check_features.py
python3 scripts/check_device_formats.py
python3 scripts/check_eft.py
python3 scripts/check_lean_eft.py
python3 scripts/check_axioms.py
python3 scripts/check_docs.py
```

`validate.py` and the feature scripts compare traces/rounding with independent exact arithmetic and recorded GPU words. `check_eft.py` runs scalar coverage, instruction-group comparisons, pinned paper generators, and the bounded EFT comparisons. `check_lean_eft.py` compares native scalar folds with an ordered-encoding rounding oracle.

The Accurate Models paper's original inputs and expected outputs remain under [`vendor/matlab-tensor-core-v0.5/model_validation/`](../vendor/matlab-tensor-core-v0.5/model_validation/), with hashes in [`vendor/SOURCES.json`](../vendor/SOURCES.json). Both implementations replay all 35,000 rows: V100/A100/H100 FP16 and A100/H100 BF16/TF32, 5,000 per group. The original A/B/C inputs and D outputs are preserved.

Follow one recorded V100 row through the implementation:

1. [check_device.py](../scripts/check_device.py) reads A/B/C and converts the FP32-stored operand values exactly to FP16 words. D is reserved as the expected output.
2. [Main/Trace.lean](../Main/Trace.lean) parses the words into `BlockInput` and calls the [snapshot adapter](TensorCoreTests/TC/Cases.lean).
3. The adapter calls `evalBlock` in [TC/Block.lean](../TensorCore/TC/Block.lean), which performs decoding, exact raw multiplication, grid selection, signed truncation, accumulation, and FP32 conversion.
4. Python compares the returned `bits` with the original D word and fails on any mismatch. D is never supplied to this model calculation.

The first published V100 row can be run directly:

```sh
lake build tc_trace
.lake/build/bin/tc_trace 3bd5 38ca 3c3e b935 b534 36bf 3df8 34ec 3f7f418c
python3 scripts/check_device.py
```

The JSON reports `bits` as an integer whose hexadecimal representation is `3f9b7dec`, matching the first recorded D. Its alignment exponent `eta` is `-1` and grid exponent `qExponent` is `-24`. The final command compares all 5,000 V100 rows.

The semantic proof is a separate guarantee: [`PaperSpec.supported_eq_paper`](../TensorCore/TC/Specification/Supported.lean) equates the executable evaluator with the independent mathematical specification for every input of each supported profile, including rejection. `python3 scripts/check_paper_spec.py` checks this development and its dependency-independence controls. The [theorem index](../TensorCore/THEOREMS.md) identifies the non-monotonicity and EFT results and their premises.

The universal proofs concern the defined finite-domain model under their stated hypotheses. Agreement with recorded GPU outputs covers those recorded inputs; correspondence between the specification, the paper, and physical hardware remains a separate specification question.

`check_axioms.py` rebuilds the full regression environment before auditing theorem roots and scanning maintained Lean sources for proof shortcuts. The permitted axioms are `propext`, `Classical.choice`, and `Quot.sound`. The audit regression deliberately puts broken source behind a valid cache and requires rejection. Specification and bounded-execution audits also contain deliberate dependency-contamination controls that must fail.

Use ordinary `python3`, without `-O` or `PYTHONOPTIMIZE`, because numerical harness assertions form part of the check. A parse error, failed Lean process, unexpected record count, or failed comparison stops the harness. Successful reports go under `data/regressions/`; intermediate batches and logs go under ignored `tmp/`.

For the complete gate:

```sh
python3 scripts/check_clean_build.py
```

It builds a fresh source snapshot without `.lake`, runs the maintained checks, checks every worked `.lean` file, and verifies Markdown Lean examples and local links. Source hashes must remain stable before it publishes the reports.

## 7. Check the independent FloatLib implementation

```sh
cd floatlib-port
python3 scripts/check_all.py
lake env lean tests/RepresentationFacts.lean
python3 scripts/check_equivalence.py
```

These commands use the FloatLib project's own toolchain and executable. `check_all.py` builds universal equivalence proofs and runs source-independence/trust audits, paper cases, recorded-vector replay, and non-monotonicity boundaries. The direct comparator snapshots the current parent source and compares both implementations' observations and decoding results. [The folder guide](../floatlib-port/FOLDER_GUIDE.md) explains each field and comparator.

## Adding a regression

Put a maintained case in `tests/TensorCoreTests/TC/` or `EFT/`, import the relevant production module, and give its assertion a name in the existing regression namespace:

```lean
import TensorCore.TC.Block

open TensorCore
namespace TensorCore.Regression

def walkthroughCase : BlockInput v100F16F32 :=
  ⟨List.replicate 4 (0x3c00, 0x3c00), 0⟩

theorem walkthrough_case_bits :
    ((evalBlock walkthroughCase).toOption.map fun t => t.output.bits) = some 0x40800000 := by
  decide +kernel

end TensorCore.Regression
```

Add the module to `tests/TensorCoreTests.lean` so the full audit imports it. Run `lake build TensorCoreTests` and check the individual file. Update the theorem index when adding a public result. The layout check rejects a module omitted from the full audit.

For an exploratory calculation, use a scratch Lean file and `lake env lean /path/to/scratch.lean`. For a larger family, prefer applying a symbolic production theorem or extending an independent executable comparison; finite examples alone do not prove a universal arithmetic claim.
