title: Ozaki-II, proved end to end
description: The complete Lean proof of Ozaki-II on the Tensor Core and AMD matrix-core models, from scaling and residues to Chinese-remainder reconstruction and the final rounding, and its correctly rounded variant.
---

Ozaki-II (Ozaki, Uchino and Imamura, 2025) computes `x · y` with one engine
call per modulus instead of one per slice pair. It scales the inputs to
integers, computes their product modulo a few small moduli on the engine,
where the residues are small enough to multiply exactly, rebuilds the integer
product with the Chinese remainder theorem (CRT), and rounds once. The only
approximation is the first step. Every step below is a Lean theorem in
[`ozaki/`](https://github.com/pauljiang03/TC-EFT/tree/main/ozaki), checked
with only Lean's standard axioms.

## The algorithm for one output entry

1. **Scale and truncate** `x` to integers `a` of at most `P` bits, scaling by
   `2^sₓ` so that the largest entry is near `2^P`; the same for `y` and `c`.
2. **Residues.** For each modulus `m`, reduce `a` and `c` to symmetric residues
   in `(−m/2, m/2]` and compute their dot product on the engine.
3. **Reconstruct** `a · c` from its residues with the CRT. This is exact when
   `2 k 2^(2P) < M`, the product of the moduli.
4. **Round once:** `fl(2^(−sₓ−s_y) (a · c))`.

The Z3 models use `k = 4`, the moduli `{4096, 4095, 4093, 4091}` (`M ≈ 2^48`)
and `P = 22`: four engine calls per entry.

## Step 1: scaling and truncation

| Fact | Lean |
| --- | --- |
| The scaled row maximum lies in `(2^(P−1), 2^P]`, and every truncated integer has magnitude at most `2^P`. | [`scaleShift_spec`](https://github.com/pauljiang03/TC-EFT/blob/main/ozaki/Ozaki/Checks.lean#L45), [`scaleTrunc_bound`](https://github.com/pauljiang03/TC-EFT/blob/main/ozaki/Ozaki/Ozaki2.lean#L51) |
| The truncation error: `\|x · y − 2^(−sₓ−s_y)(a · c)\| ≤ Σᵢ (2^(−sₓ)\|yᵢ\| + 2^(−sₓ−s_y)\|aᵢ\|)`, at most `8 k max\|x\| max\|y\| 2^(−P)`. | [`truncProduct_error`](https://github.com/pauljiang03/TC-EFT/blob/main/ozaki/Ozaki/Ozaki2.lean#L127), [`truncProduct_error_normwise`](https://github.com/pauljiang03/TC-EFT/blob/main/ozaki/Ozaki/Ozaki2.lean#L159) |

## Step 2: residues on the engine

| Fact | Lean |
| --- | --- |
| Symmetric residues lie in `(−m/2, m/2]`, and the product of the residues is congruent to the product modulo `m`. | [`symMod_bounds`](https://github.com/pauljiang03/TC-EFT/blob/main/ozaki/Ozaki/CRT.lean#L32), [`dvd_dotZ_symMod`](https://github.com/pauljiang03/TC-EFT/blob/main/ozaki/Ozaki/Ozaki2.lean#L239) |
| A residue product has magnitude at most `k ⌊m/2⌋²`, at most `2^24` for the Z3 moduli. | [`natAbs_residueProduct_le`](https://github.com/pauljiang03/TC-EFT/blob/main/ozaki/Ozaki/Checks.lean#L69), [`z3_residue_budget`](https://github.com/pauljiang03/TC-EFT/blob/main/ozaki/Ozaki/Checks.lean#L83) |
| The engine computes each residue product exactly: residues of moduli at most `2^(b+1)` are `b`-bit integers, and the Tensor Core and matrix-core engines are exact on those. | [`tcEngine_exactOn`](https://github.com/pauljiang03/TC-EFT/blob/main/ozaki/OzakiTC/Engine.lean#L193), [`mcEngine_exactOn`](https://github.com/pauljiang03/TC-EFT/blob/main/ozaki/OzakiMC/Engine.lean#L326) |

## Step 3: Chinese-remainder reconstruction

```lean
theorem crt_eq {B : CRTBasis} (hB : B.Valid) {rs : List ℤ} (hlen : rs.length = B.moduli.length)
    {c : ℤ} (hres : ∀ j : Fin B.moduli.length, (B.moduli[j] : ℤ) ∣ rs.getD j 0 - c)
    (h1 : -(B.modulus : ℤ) < 2 * c) (h2 : 2 * c ≤ B.modulus) : crt B rs = c
```

For any valid basis (pairwise coprime moduli with the CRT weights), the
reconstruction returns every `c` with `−M < 2c ≤ M` from residues congruent to
it ([`crt_eq`](https://github.com/pauljiang03/TC-EFT/blob/main/ozaki/Ozaki/CRT.lean#L156)), and it matches every residue ([`crt_dvd_sub`](https://github.com/pauljiang03/TC-EFT/blob/main/ozaki/Ozaki/Checks.lean#L94)). For the Z3
moduli the weights form a valid basis ([`z3Basis_valid`](https://github.com/pauljiang03/TC-EFT/blob/main/ozaki/Ozaki/Parameters.lean#L46)) and `P = 22` is the
largest precision with `2 k 2^(2P) < M` ([`z3_bits`](https://github.com/pauljiang03/TC-EFT/blob/main/ozaki/Ozaki/Parameters.lean#L56)). At `P = 23` the product
can reach `M` itself, whose residues are all zero, so it reconstructs as `0`
([`crt_fails_at_23`](https://github.com/pauljiang03/TC-EFT/blob/main/ozaki/Ozaki/Parameters.lean#L63)).

## Step 4: the whole scheme

| Fact | Lean |
| --- | --- |
| With an exact engine, Ozaki-II is one rounding of the truncated product. | [`ozaki2_eq`](https://github.com/pauljiang03/TC-EFT/blob/main/ozaki/Ozaki/Ozaki2.lean#L280) |
| Its error: one rounding plus the truncation bound. | [`ozaki2_error`](https://github.com/pauljiang03/TC-EFT/blob/main/ozaki/Ozaki/Ozaki2.lean#L332), [`tcOzaki2_error`](https://github.com/pauljiang03/TC-EFT/blob/main/ozaki/OzakiTC/Schemes.lean#L82) |
| It returns a value (never Inf or NaN) when the product is within range. | [`ozaki2_isSome`](https://github.com/pauljiang03/TC-EFT/blob/main/ozaki/Ozaki/Success.lean#L160) |
| The Z3 configuration runs exactly on V100. | [`v100_ozaki2_z3`](https://github.com/pauljiang03/TC-EFT/blob/main/ozaki/OzakiTC/Schemes.lean#L113) |

On the Z3 models' test matrices the Lean pipeline returns the same binary32
words as the Z3 model on every fp16 and tf32 path and on the AMD paths.

## Dot products of any length, and FP64

The reconstruction range grows with `k`, so a longer dot product needs more
moduli or a smaller `P`; the engine side is handled by split-K, which runs
each residue product in chunks and adds the chunk results exactly
([`chunked_exactOn`](https://github.com/pauljiang03/TC-EFT/blob/main/ozaki/Ozaki/SplitK.lean#L130)). With binary64 inputs and enough moduli, Ozaki-II
emulates FP64 on fp16, bf16 and tf32 Tensor Cores and on AMD matrix cores; the
tests use twelve moduli at most `4096` (`P = 69` for `k = 8`).

## Correctly rounded Ozaki-II

Ozaki-II rounds once, but it rounds the product of the *truncated* inputs. On
the Z3 test matrices that is never the correctly rounded `x · y`: with
`P = 22`, two bits short of binary32's `24`, results are off by up to 68
binary32 steps.

The correctly rounded variant uses the same check as Ozaki-I. Before its last
rounding, Ozaki-II holds `H`, the reconstructed product, exactly, and the
truncation bound gives `B ≥ |x · y − H|` ([`dot_approx_error`](https://github.com/pauljiang03/TC-EFT/blob/main/ozaki/Ozaki/Correct.lean#L173)). If `H − B`
and `H + B` round to the same value, so does `x · y`; otherwise more moduli
are tried, and finally an exact path ([`ozaki2CR_eq`](https://github.com/pauljiang03/TC-EFT/blob/main/ozaki/Ozaki/Correct.lean#L296)). The exact path can run
on the engine too, as Ozaki-I with all slice products ([`ozaki2CRE_eq`](https://github.com/pauljiang03/TC-EFT/blob/main/ozaki/Ozaki/Correct.lean#L538)), so
every engine product, residue or slice, runs on the hardware model:

- binary32, any length: [`tcOzaki2CRL_eq`](https://github.com/pauljiang03/TC-EFT/blob/main/ozaki/OzakiTC/LongDot.lean#L158), [`mcOzaki2CRL_eq`](https://github.com/pauljiang03/TC-EFT/blob/main/ozaki/OzakiMC/LongDot.lean#L74);
- FP64, any length: [`tcOzaki2CRD_eq`](https://github.com/pauljiang03/TC-EFT/blob/main/ozaki/OzakiTC/LongDot.lean#L218), [`mcOzaki2CRD_eq`](https://github.com/pauljiang03/TC-EFT/blob/main/ozaki/OzakiMC/LongDot.lean#L128).

Correct rounding costs Ozaki-II more than Ozaki-I, because it has no margin at
`P = 22`. On the Z3 test matrices four moduli settle no entry, five settle 21
of 32, and six settle all of them.

## What the proof assumes

- **The hardware models**, validated against GPUs by measurement, not proved.
- **The conditions**: valid moduli at most `2^(b+1)`, `2 k 2^(2P) < M`, and the
  engine's budget per call (or split-K).
- **Exact arithmetic off the engine**: the scaling, the reconstruction and the
  rounding check are exact integer and rational arithmetic in the proofs. The
  bounded-register form of the check is proved for Ozaki-I only.
