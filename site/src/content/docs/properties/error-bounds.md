title: Error bounds
description: Where a Tensor Core block loses accuracy, with an exact residual identity and a two-part error bound.
---

The model loses information in exactly two places: alignment truncation and
the final RZ conversion. The library names both losses and proves that
together they account for the whole error.

## Exact residual identity

```lean
def BlockTrace.residual (t : BlockTrace) : ℚ := t.block.extractReference t.output.value
-- = (accumulator − output) + Σ alignment residuals

theorem evalBlock_residual_identity {p : Profile} {x : BlockInput p} {t : BlockTrace}
    (h : evalBlock x = .ok t) :
    exactDot x = some (t.output.value + t.residual)
```

Whenever the model succeeds, the exact sum `C + Σ aᵢbᵢ` of the decoded
inputs equals the output plus the residual. Here the residual is the
conversion loss plus the alignment losses. The exact sum is computed from the
input words directly (`exactDot`), not from the model's intermediate values.

## Two-part error bound

```lean
theorem evalBlock_error_bound {p : Profile} {x : BlockInput p} {t : BlockTrace}
    (h : evalBlock x = .ok t) :
    absQ (t.block.exactDot - t.output.value) <
      (t.block.terms.length : ℚ) * pow2 t.block.quantumExponent +
        pow2 (outputQuantumExponent t.output.bits)
```

So the error is less than

```text
(K + 1) · 2^(η − F)    +    ulp(D)
  alignment loss          conversion loss
```

Each of the `K + 1` terms loses less than one grid step, and RZ conversion
loses less than one output ulp. The bound uses only quantities in the trace,
and [`evalBlock_success_iff`](https://github.com/pauljiang03/TC-EFT/blob/main/TensorCore/TC/AcceptedDomain.lean#L33)
says exactly when it applies.

The alignment term depends on η, the **largest** exponent in the group, not
on the size of the result. When large terms cancel, `2^(η − F)` can be far
bigger than the ulp of the result. In that case the relative error is large,
however exact the hardware is otherwise. This loss is what TC-EFT exists to
recover.

## Chains

For chained groups,
[`runBlocks_residual_ledger`](https://github.com/pauljiang03/TC-EFT/blob/main/TensorCore/TC/Composition.lean#L93)
gives the same identity across the whole chain. The initial `C` plus every
product equals the last output plus the sum of all the groups' residuals.
