title: 3. Alignment
description: The alignment exponent η, the profile floor, the grid 2^(η−F), and truncation toward zero.

Alignment is where a Tensor Core loses information, and it is the core of the
model. All terms (`C` and the `K` unnormalized products) are put on one fixed-point
grid. Anything below the grid is discarded.

## Step 1: the alignment exponent η

```lean
/-- A nonempty maximum ignores zero terms; none explicitly represents an all-zero block. -/
def maxTermExp (ts : List UnnormalizedProduct) : Option ℤ :=
  (ts.filterMap fun t => if t.significand = 0 then none else some t.unnormalizedExp).foldl
    (fun acc e => some (match acc with | none => e | some v => max v e)) none

/-- The floor only raises a nonempty maximum; an all-zero block stays `none`. -/
def Profile.applyFloor (p : Profile) : Option ℤ → Option ℤ
  | none => none
  | some e => some (match p.alignFloor with | none => e | some f => max e f)

def PreparedBlock.alignExp (b : PreparedBlock) : Option ℤ :=
  b.profile.applyFloor (maxTermExp b.terms)
```

- η is the **largest unnormalized exponent among the nonzero terms**. Zero terms are
  skipped, so a zero product never coarsens the grid.
- If every term is zero, η is `none`. The accumulator is then exactly zero
  and the output is `+0`.
- Ampere and Hopper have an **alignment floor** (`−132` and `−133`): η is
  never below it. The floor only matters when every term is tiny, for example
  products of subnormals. It then coarsens the grid and flushes those terms
  toward zero. V100 has no floor.

## Step 2: the grid

```lean
def PreparedBlock.alignGridExponent (b : PreparedBlock) : ℤ :=
  b.alignExp.getD 0 - b.profile.alignSigBits
```

The grid spacing is `2^(η − F)`, where `F = alignSigBits = 23 + p`. Here `p`
is the number of **extra alignment bits** the architecture keeps beyond
FP32's 23 mantissa bits: 0 on V100, 1 on A100, 2 on H100. A larger `p` gives
a finer grid, so less is lost.

## Step 3: truncation toward zero

```lean
/-- Signed magnitude truncation. -/
def truncCoeff (x : ℚ) (e : ℤ) : ℤ :=
  if x < 0 then -((-x / pow2 e).floor) else (x / pow2 e).floor

def truncGrid (x : ℚ) (e : ℤ) : ℚ := (truncCoeff x e : ℚ) * pow2 e

def PreparedBlock.coefficients (b : PreparedBlock) : List ℤ :=
  b.terms.map fun t => truncCoeff t.value b.alignGridExponent
```

[`truncCoeff`](https://github.com/pauljiang03/TC-EFT/blob/main/TensorCore/Numerics/Exact.lean#L70)
takes the floor of the **magnitude** and restores the sign. This is the
sign-magnitude shifter of the hardware, i.e. truncation **toward zero**, not
toward −∞. Each term becomes an integer coefficient on the grid.

## What is lost

The discarded parts are named and tracked:

```lean
def PreparedBlock.alignmentResiduals (b : PreparedBlock) : List ℚ :=
  b.terms.map fun t => t.value - truncGrid t.value b.alignGridExponent
```

Each residual is strictly smaller in magnitude than one grid step, and has the
same sign as its term:

```lean
theorem alignment_residual_bounds (x : ℚ) (e : ℤ) :
    -pow2 e < x - truncGrid x e ∧ x - truncGrid x e < pow2 e
```

These residuals are what [TC-EFT](/TC-EFT/properties/eft/) recovers, and the
first half of the [error bound](/TC-EFT/properties/error-bounds/).

## Example: a small term disappears

V100, `F = 23`, `C = 1.0`, one product `2^-24`:

- η = max(unnormalized exponent of `C` = 0, unnormalized exponent of the product = −24) = 0.
- Grid = `2^(0 − 23) = 2^-23`.
- Product coefficient = `⌊2^-24 / 2^-23⌋ = ⌊0.5⌋ = 0`, so the product is lost.

Four such products are lost the same way, although together they are
`2^-22`, which an FP32 result near 1 could represent. Lowering `C` slightly
moves η to −1 and keeps all four: that is the
[non-monotonicity](/TC-EFT/properties/non-monotonicity/) mechanism.
