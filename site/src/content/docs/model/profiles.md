title: 6. Architecture profiles
description: How V100, A100, and H100 Tensor Core paths are parameterized, and the general InvocationSpec interface.
---

The pipeline is the same on every GPU. Architectures differ only in a few
parameters, and a `Profile` collects them:

```lean
structure Profile where
  input : Format          -- fp16, bf16, or tf19
  products : ℕ            -- K
  alignMantissaBits : ℤ       -- F = 23 + p
  alignFloor : Option ℤ   -- minimum alignment exponent
```

## The supported paths

All of them have FP32 `C` and FP32 output. The parameters follow Table 3 of
*Accurate Models* (Khattak and Mikaitis).

| Path | Lean profile | Input | K | p (F = 23 + p) | Floor |
| --- | --- | --- | ---: | ---: | ---: |
| V100 FP16 | `v100F16F32` | FP16 | 4 | 0 | none |
| A100 FP16 | `ampereF16F32` | FP16 | 8 | 1 | −132 |
| A100 BF16 | `a100BF16F32` | BF16 | 8 | 1 | −132 |
| A100 TF32 | `a100TF32F32` | TF32 | 4 | 1 | −132 |
| H100 FP16 | `hopperF16F32` | FP16 | 16 | 2 | −133 |
| H100 BF16 | `hopperBF16F32` | BF16 | 16 | 2 | −133 |
| H100 TF32 (WMMA) | `hopperTF32WmmaF32` | TF32 | 4 | 2 | −133 |
| H100 TF32 (MMA) | `hopperTF32MmaF32` | TF32 | 8 | 2 | −133 |

They are built from generic constructors, for example:

```lean
def fp16Fp32Profile (K extraBits : ℕ) (floor : Option ℤ := none) : Profile :=
  ⟨fp16, K, (23 + extraBits : ℕ), floor⟩

def ampereF16F32 : Profile := fp16Fp32Profile 8 1 (some (-132))
def hopperF16F32 : Profile := fp16Fp32Profile 16 2 (some (-133))
```

Most theorems are stated for **arbitrary** `K`, `p`, and floor, and the named
profiles are instances. Choosing parameters does not by itself establish that
a GPU behaves that way. That link comes from the
[hardware replay](/TC-EFT/model/validation/).

The independent specification transcribes the same eight parameter sets on
its own, as `IndependentSpec.parameters`. `supported_parameters` checks with `rfl`
that the two transcriptions match.

## Beyond one block: `InvocationSpec`

[`InvocationSpec`](https://github.com/pauljiang03/TC-EFT/blob/main/TensorCore/TC/Invocation.lean#L18)
is a more general description of a Tensor Core invocation. Profiles embed
into it, and it can express variations the basic profile cannot:

```lean
inductive CPlacement where
  | inGroup                                        -- C is aligned with the products
  | afterProducts (stages : List RoundingStage)  -- products rounded first, then C added exactly

inductive AccumulationKind where
  | aligned (alignMantissaBits : ℕ) (floor : Option ℤ) (cPlacement : CPlacement)
  | fused                                          -- exact single-product FMA (e.g. FP64 DMMA)

structure InvocationSpec where
  input : OperandEncoding        -- includes TF32's padded register words
  cFormat : Format
  products : ℕ
  accumulation : AccumulationKind
  intermediate : List RoundingStage := []
  output : RoundingStage       -- output format and rounding direction
```

- `Profile.toInvocation` embeds a profile as an aligned, in-group,
  FP32-toward-zero invocation, and the compatibility theorems show the
  results are equal.
- `binary64Fma mode` models an FP64 DMMA as a **fused** operation: one
  correctly rounded result in any of four directions (`binary64Fma_correct`).
- Output stages may use any well-formed format and rounding direction. Each
  is proved correct (`evalInvocation_output_nearestEven`,
  `..._towardZero`, `..._towardNegative`, `..._towardPositive`).

The headline theorems and the hardware validation concern the eight aligned
FP32-output paths in the table. The general interface is there for
experimenting with other configurations.
