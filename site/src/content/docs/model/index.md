title: The model at a glance
description: How TC-EFT turns encoded Tensor Core inputs into an FP32 output word in Lean, end to end.
---

This section explains how Tensor Core arithmetic is represented in Lean. It
covers the data types, every stage of `evalBlock`, the architecture
parameters, and how the model is tied to an independent specification and to
GPU measurements.

## The hardware behavior being modeled

One Tensor Core *normalization group* computes

```text
D = C + a₁·b₁ + a₂·b₂ + … + a_K·b_K
```

where `aᵢ, bᵢ` are FP16, BF16, or TF32 words, `C` is an FP32 word, `D` is an
FP32 word, and `K` (4, 8, or 16) depends on the GPU and the input format.
Khattak and Mikaitis (*[Accurate Models of NVIDIA Tensor
Cores](https://arxiv.org/html/2512.07004v4)*) found that NVIDIA hardware does **not** round this sum
once, the way a fused dot product would. It does the following:

1. Forms each product **exactly**, without normalizing the significand.
2. Finds the **largest exponent** among the nonzero terms (including `C`),
   optionally raised to a hardware **floor**.
3. **Aligns** every term to a fixed-point grid `F` bits below that exponent,
   and **truncates** (toward zero) any bits below the grid.
4. **Adds** the aligned bits exactly, in a fixed-point adder.
5. **Converts** the sum to FP32 by **truncating** it: bits beyond FP32's 24
   significant bits are dropped (IEEE calls this round toward zero).

The Lean model implements these five steps directly.

The whole model is about 120 lines, in
[`TensorCore/TC/Block.lean`](https://github.com/pauljiang03/TC-EFT/blob/main/TensorCore/TC/Block.lean).
These are its definitions, unchanged apart from omitted comments:

```lean
structure Profile where
  input : Format          -- operand format: fp16, bf16, or tf19 (packed TF32)
  products : ℕ            -- K, the number of products per group
  alignMantissaBits : ℤ       -- F = 23 + p, mantissa bits kept after alignment
  alignFloor : Option ℤ   -- lower bound on the alignment exponent, if any

structure BlockInput (p : Profile) where
  products : List (p.Word × p.Word)   -- encoded (aᵢ, bᵢ) pairs
  c : F32                             -- encoded FP32 accumulator input

def PreparedBlock.terms (b : PreparedBlock) : List UnnormalizedProduct :=
  ⟨b.c.significand, b.c.unnormalizedExp, b.c.mantissaBits⟩ ::
    b.products.map fun (a, b) => unnormalizedMul a b

def PreparedBlock.alignExp (b : PreparedBlock) : Option ℤ :=
  b.profile.applyFloor (maxTermExp b.terms)

def PreparedBlock.alignGridExponent (b : PreparedBlock) : ℤ :=
  b.alignExp.getD 0 - b.profile.alignMantissaBits

def PreparedBlock.coefficients (b : PreparedBlock) : List ℤ :=
  b.terms.map fun t => truncCoeff t.value b.alignGridExponent

def PreparedBlock.accumulator (b : PreparedBlock) : ℚ :=
  (sumZ b.coefficients : ℚ) * pow2 b.alignGridExponent

def evalPrepared (b : PreparedBlock) : Except ModelError BlockTrace :=
  match round32 .towardZero b.accumulator with
  | none => .error .accumulatorOutOfRange
  | some bits => match finite32 bits with
    | none => .error .nonfiniteOutput
    | some d => .ok ⟨b, d⟩

def evalBlock {p : Profile} (x : BlockInput p) : Except ModelError BlockTrace :=
  if x.products.length != p.products then .error .wrongProductCount
  else match prepare x with
    | none => .error .nonfiniteInput
    | some b => evalPrepared b
```

### Names used in the code

| Lean name | Meaning | In *Accurate Models* / its MATLAB code |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `significand` | The significand bits, hidden bit included, with the sign | significand (`a_sig`, `prod_sig`) |
| `unnormalizedExp` | Exponent as the hardware sees it. For an input, its unbiased exponent (minimum normal exponent for subnormals). For a product, the sum of the input exponents, with no renormalization. | "sum of exponents"; products "remain denormalised" (`prod_exp`) |
| `mantissaBits` | Mantissa width: how many low bits of the significand lie after the binary point. For a format or an input value, the stored mantissa width (10 for FP16). For a product, the sum of both inputs' widths (20 for FP16 × FP16). value = `significand · 2^(unnormalizedExp − mantissaBits)` | mantissa bits (`manBits`) |
| `UnnormalizedProduct`, `unnormalizedMul` | An exact product kept in that unnormalized form | `prod_sig`, `prod_exp` with `denorm_prd` |
| `alignExp` (η) | Alignment exponent: largest `unnormalizedExp` of a nonzero term, raised to the floor | maximum exponent, "capped from below" |
| `alignMantissaBits` (F) | Mantissa bits each term keeps after alignment, counted below the alignment exponent: `23 + p` | 23 + `neab` |
| `alignGridExponent` | Exponent of the alignment grid step, `η − F` | |
| `outputUlpExponent` | Exponent of one unit in the last place of the FP32 output | |

Three design choices run through the model:

- **Exact arithmetic everywhere.** Values are `ℤ` and `ℚ`. Neither Lean's
  `Float` nor a floating-point library is used. The only lossy steps are the
  two the hardware performs: the alignment truncation (`truncCoeff`) and the
  final rounding (`round32 .towardZero`).
- **Bits in, bits out.** Inputs are `BitVec` words and the output is an
  `F32 = BitVec 32`. Theorems can therefore state facts about exact bit
  patterns, including signed zero.
- **Failure is explicit.** `evalBlock` returns `Except ModelError BlockTrace`.
  It rejects inputs with the wrong number of products, NaN or infinity
  operands, and sums that overflow FP32. The proved theorem
  [`evalBlock_success_iff`](https://github.com/pauljiang03/TC-EFT/blob/main/TensorCore/TC/AcceptedDomain.lean#L33)
  gives the exact accepted domain, so no input is rejected silently.

## A worked trace

Here is the V100 profile (`K = 4`, `F = 23`, no floor) with four FP16 products
`2^-12 × 2^-12`, run for two values of `C`:

| Stage | `C = 1.0` (`0x3f800000`) | `C = 1 − 2^-24` (`0x3f7fffff`) |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Decode `C` | `1.000…0` (24 bits) × `2^0` | `1.111…1` (24 ones) × `2^-1` |
| Each product | value `2^-24`, unnormalized exponent `−24` | same |
| `η` = largest unnormalized exponent | `0` | `−1` |
| Grid `2^(η − F)` | `2^-23` | `2^-24` |
| Bits of `C` kept | all 24 | all 24 |
| Each product's single bit at `2^-24` | below the grid: dropped | on the grid: kept |
| Accumulator | `1` | `1 + 3·2^-24` |
| Truncate to FP32 | `1.0` | `1 + 2^-23` |

The smaller `C` moves the grid one bit lower, so the four products survive
alignment and the output **increases**. This is the
[non-monotonicity](/TC-EFT/properties/non-monotonicity/) that the library
proves in general. Both rows can be checked in Lean:

```lean
import TensorCore.TC

open TensorCore

def before : BlockInput v100F16F32 := ⟨List.replicate 4 (0x0c00, 0x0c00), 0x3f800000⟩
def after  : BlockInput v100F16F32 := ⟨List.replicate 4 (0x0c00, 0x0c00), 0x3f7fffff⟩

example : ((evalBlock before).toOption.map fun t => t.output.bits) = some 0x3f800000 ∧
          ((evalBlock after).toOption.map  fun t => t.output.bits) = some 0x3f800001 := by
  decide +kernel
```
