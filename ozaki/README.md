# Ozaki schemes on TC-EFT's Tensor Core and Matrix-Core models

This Lean project formalizes the Ozaki schemes for emulating a high-precision matrix product on a
low-precision matrix engine, following a set of bit-precise Z3 models of the schemes (the "Z3
models" below):

* **Ozaki-I** (Ozaki, Ogita, Oishi and Rump, 2012): error-free slicing into small integers, exact
  slice products on the engine, and recombination;
* **Ozaki-II** (Ozaki, Uchino and Imamura, 2025): scaling to integers, one engine product per
  modulus, and Chinese-remainder reconstruction;
* **ADP and ESC** (Schwarz et al., NVIDIA, arXiv:2511.13778): Ozaki-I on INT8 engines, with the
  unsigned slice encoding and the exponent span capacity.

The Z3 models take the engine to be fp16 inputs with binary32 round-to-nearest additions. Here
the engine is the hardware model of this repository: the NVIDIA Tensor Core model of
[`TensorCore`](../README.md) and the AMD matrix-core model of [`MatrixCore`](../amd/README.md).
The scheme itself is proved once, for any engine, and each hardware model is shown to satisfy
what the scheme needs. Every labelled check of the three Z3 models has a Lean theorem or a
kernel-checked test, except the ones listed under [what is not proved](THEOREMS.md#not-proved).

Beyond the Z3 models:

* **Long dot products.** Split-K (chunks of the inner dimension, each an exact engine call, added
  exactly) lifts the engine's limit `k · 2^(2b) ≤ 2^24`, so every result holds for every `k`.
* **FP64 emulation** on fp16, bf16 and tf32 Tensor Cores and on AMD matrix cores: Ozaki-I and
  Ozaki-II on binary64 inputs, with binary64 error bounds and correctly rounded binary64 results.
* **Correct rounding.** All three schemes have a variant that returns the round to nearest even of
  the exact product for every input on which the engine is exact ([below](#correct-rounding)).
* **IEEE special values.** `±Inf` on overflow, NaN and infinite inputs, and signed zeros, for every
  correctly rounded scheme, native GEMM, plain Ozaki-I and Ozaki-II, and the ADP routine, whose
  Inf and NaN results match the Z3 model's.
* **One rounding on both vendors.** Every scheme rounds with IEEE's round to nearest even;
  TensorCore's and MatrixCore's own roundings are proved to compute the same values on their ranges.
* **Fixed-width integer arithmetic.** Each correctly rounded scheme is also one integer function
  from `(significand, exponent)` inputs, with one theorem bounding every register; no width depends
  on the inputs' exponents.
* **What the hardware semantics give.** The exact condition for a matrix-engine call, cancellation
  included, the two-pass recovery of full groups, and the cheapest exact choice of slices, chunks
  and passes on each GPU.
* **Sharper error bounds**: an entrywise Ozaki-I bound, Ozaki-II's truncation bound without its
  cross term, and Jeannerod–Rump's `k·u` for native dot products.

## Build and run

`ozaki/` is a standalone Lake project that requires the two models by path (`..` and `../amd`);
all three use Lean 4.33.1. From this directory:

```sh
lake build
lake env lean examples/TensorCore.lean
lake env lean examples/MatrixCore.lean
python3 scripts/check.py
```

`lake build` builds the three libraries and the two test libraries, which check the Z3 models'
recorded outputs and an exact-arithmetic oracle by kernel evaluation, and audit the axioms.
`scripts/check.py` also checks the examples and every Lean block in the documentation. The test
modules evaluate large terms in the kernel, the largest for about two minutes each; a bare
`lake build` runs them in parallel, which can exhaust memory (it did on a 24 GB machine), so
`check.py` builds them one at a time.

`TensorCore` and `MatrixCore` cannot be imported into the same file: both declare the `ℕ ℤ ℚ`
notation and their own arithmetic. `Ozaki` therefore uses Lean's types directly, so it can be
imported beside either, and `OzakiTC` and `OzakiMC` are separate libraries.

## The scheme for one output entry

Every entry of `C = AB` is a dot product `x · y` of a row of `A` and a column of `B`, and the
schemes treat each entry separately. An `Engine` is a function from two integer vectors to the
value the hardware returns; `Engine.ExactOn b budget` says it returns `Σ xᵢyᵢ` exactly for entries
of magnitude at most `2^b` whose products total at most `budget`.

* Ozaki-I splits `x` into `s` slices `2^gₜ qₜ` of integers with `|qₜ,ᵢ| ≤ 2^b`, multiplies the
  `s(s+1)/2` pairs with `t + u < s`, and adds the scaled products. With an exact engine the error
  is exactly `r · y + Σₜ 2^gₜ (qₜ · r'ₛ₋ₜ)`, which gives `|x · y − C| ≤ (s + 1) k 2^(E + F − s(b+1))`
  before the additions (`Ozaki.exactTerms_error`).
* Ozaki-II truncates `x` and `y` to `P`-bit integers `a` and `c`, computes `a · c` modulo each
  modulus on the engine, reconstructs it exactly when `2 k 2^(2P) < M` (`Ozaki.crt_eq`), and
  rounds once. The only approximation is the truncation (`Ozaki.truncProduct_error`).
* ADP converts each row and column to `W`-bit fixed point (`W = 53 + ESC + 1`), cuts the integers
  into byte slices, multiplies all `s²` slice pairs on an INT8 engine, recombines exactly and rounds
  once to binary64. For normal or zero entries, with full fidelity on the largest product, the
  result meets the paper's Grade-A bound `|C − x · y| ≤ (4k + 1) 2^-53 Σ|xᵢyᵢ|` plus an underflow
  term (`Ozaki.ADP.emulated_gradeA`). Subnormal entries can break it (see the findings).

## Long dot products and FP64

An engine call is exact while its products total at most `2^24`, which allows only four terms of
`11`-bit slices. Split-K cuts the inner dimension into chunks of `2^(24 − 2b)` terms (four for
`11`-bit slices, `256` for `8`-bit), runs each chunk on the engine, and adds the integer chunk
results exactly; it is exact for every length (`Ozaki.chunked_exactOn`). On the Tensor Core model
the chunk results can be accumulated in TC-EFT's fixed-width register, exact while the products
total less than `2^63` in a 64-bit register (`Ozaki.TC.tcSplitKReg_exactOn`).

With split-K:

* Ozaki-I's binary32 error bound holds for every `k` (`Ozaki.TC.tcOzaki1L_error`,
  `Ozaki.MC.mcOzaki1L_error`);
* **FP64 emulation**: Ozaki-I with binary64 recombination has the same bound with `u = 2^-53`
  (`Ozaki.TC.tcOzaki1D_error`, `Ozaki.MC.mcOzaki1D_error`), and Ozaki-I and Ozaki-II return the
  correctly rounded binary64 product for binary64 inputs of any length on every exact path
  (`Ozaki.TC.tcOzaki1CRD_eq`, `Ozaki.TC.tcOzaki2CRD_eq`, `Ozaki.MC.mcOzaki1CRD_eq`,
  `Ozaki.MC.mcOzaki2CRD_eq`), for example on V100 fp16 with `11`-bit slices and on A100 bf16 with
  `8`-bit slices (`Ozaki.TC.v100_fp64CR`, `Ozaki.TC.a100BF16_fp64CR`).

Every working-precision rounding is `Ozaki.roundRNE`, a hardware-independent IEEE round to nearest
even proved for any binary format (`Ozaki.roundRNE_nearest`), with IEEE overflow: values that
round to at most the largest finite value succeed. Its instances are `Ozaki.rne32Q` and
`Ozaki.rne64`. The hardware libraries' own roundings compute the same values:

* TensorCore's binary32 and binary64 round to nearest use the same exponent, grid and
  ties-to-even step (`Ozaki.TC.signedRounded_eq_rneU`, `Ozaki.TC.binarySignedRounded_eq_rneU`),
  so they agree with IEEE's on every input up to the largest finite value
  (`Ozaki.TC.round32ValueTC_eq`, `Ozaki.TC.fp64RoundTC_eq`). They differ only above it, where they
  return nothing and IEEE rounds values within half an ulp down to the largest finite value.
* MatrixCore's binary32 round to nearest is IEEE's on every input
  (`Ozaki.MC.round32Value_eq_rne32Q`).

So the NVIDIA and AMD instantiations round with literally the same function, and the correctly
rounded variants return the same value on both for the same inputs.

## Correct rounding

Each scheme holds an exact value `H` before its last rounding (the slice products added exactly,
the reconstructed product, the recombined fixed-point product) and a proved bound
`B ≥ |x · y − H|`. If `H − B` and `H + B` round to the same value, so does `x · y`, which lies
between them: rounding to nearest is monotone, which Lean proves from the nearest-value property
alone (`Ozaki.round_monotone`). Otherwise the next configuration is tried, more slices or moduli,
and then an exact path (`Ozaki.certify_eq`). The structure is TC-EFT's guarded fast path with an
exact fallback; the check itself is Ziv's rounding test.

There are two kinds of variants, and the difference matters:

* `Ozaki.ozaki1CR_eq`, `Ozaki.ozaki2CR_eq`, `Ozaki.TC.adpCR_eq` fall back to the exact rational
  `x · y`, computed off the engine. Their theorems would hold for a scheme that never calls the
  engine; their content is that the engine's enclosures are sound.
* `Ozaki.ozaki1CRE_eq`, `Ozaki.ozaki2CRE_eq` and their hardware instances (`*CRE`, `*CRL`, `*CRD`)
  take the exact path on the engine: Ozaki-I with all `s²` slice products is exact once nothing is
  left over (`Ozaki.ozaki1Full_eq`), and inputs on a grid `2^m` leave nothing over after enough
  slices (`Ozaki.split_residual_zero`): `24` slices of `11` bits for binary32, `175` for binary64.
  Every engine product, including the exact path's, then runs on Tensor Core or matrix-core
  blocks. The slicing and the check are exact arithmetic in the proofs.

**The check needs only a small accumulator.** Correct rounding has to decide only on which side of
the nearest rounding boundary `x · y` lies, so the sum of the slice products need not be exact:
round each scaled product down to a window of `W` bits below the largest possible product, add
them exactly, and add the window's loss to `B` (`Ozaki.ozaki1CRW_eq`). The window sum needs
`W + log₂ (s(s+1)/2 · (k + 1)) + 1` bits whatever the inputs' exponents
(`Ozaki.ozaki1Window_register`): with `W = 96`, up to seven `11`-bit slices and `k ≤ 2^14`, under
two 64-bit words, for binary32 and FP64 alike (`Ozaki.TC.tcOzaki1CRDW_eq`,
`Ozaki.MC.mcOzaki1CRDW_eq`, `Ozaki.TC.v100_fp64CRW`).

**The exact path does not need a wide register either.** Added exactly, the slice products of
inputs spanning the whole exponent range take about `580` bits for binary32
(`Ozaki.exactTerms_sum_register32`). Rounding needs less: only the sign of the sum against a few
rounding boundaries. A top-down descent over windows decides it. It adds the parts of the terms
that fall in a window, carries the sum into the next window only when cancellation has made it
small, jumps over empty gaps, and visits at most `n · bitlen(max |v|) + 1` windows whatever the
exponents (`Ozaki.roundSumJ_eq`, `Ozaki.windowsJ_le`). The final round to nearest even is a few
integer comparisons (`Ozaki.roundExact_eq`), and the check's window sum is held in a
two's-complement register that never wraps (`Ozaki.fixedSum_eq`, `Ozaki.ozaki1CheckB_register`).

**Each scheme is one integer function.** From `(significand, exponent)` inputs through integer
slicing or conversion, the engine, the integer check, the exact path and the final rounding,
correctly rounded Ozaki-I, Ozaki-II and ADP-style slicing are integer functions proved correctly
rounded, with signed-zero versions (`Ozaki.ozaki1CRI_eq`, `Ozaki.ozaki2CRJ_eq`,
`Ozaki.TC.adpCRJ_eq`, `Ozaki.ozaki1CRIS_eq`). For Ozaki-II and ADP the check's bound is itself an
integer built from the scaled integers the engine already multiplies (`Ozaki.checkB_eq`).

**One theorem bounds every register.** A checked copy of each pipeline guards every integer it
computes, data against `2^R` and exponents and counters against `2^X`, and under explicit formulas
returns exactly what the unchecked pipeline returns (`Ozaki.ozaki1CRIC_eq`,
`Ozaki.ozaki2CRJC_eq`, `Ozaki.TC.adpCRJC_eq`):

| Pipeline | `R` | `X` |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Ozaki-I, FP64 (`11`-bit slices, up to `175`, `k ≤ 2^20`) | 332 | 24 |
| Ozaki-I, binary32 (up to `24` slices) | 303 | 17 |
| Ozaki-II, FP64 (twelve moduli up to `4096`, `P ≤ 69`) | 264 | 24 |
| Ozaki-II, binary32 (six moduli) | 161 | 17 |
| ADP-style, FP64 (up to `11` slices of width up to `81`) | 264 | 25 |

Kernel tests show the guards fail at narrower widths. The widths are generous, not tight, and a
few values are not guarded ([THEOREMS.md](THEOREMS.md#not-proved)).

**Exact zeros settle at once.** The slicing bound counts only the positions where both entries are
nonzero, so an entry whose products are all zero, such as sparse rows and columns with no shared
nonzero, settles on the first check (`Ozaki.exactTerms_error_overlap`, `Ozaki.ozaki1CREZ_zero`).
The count costs one extra engine dot product per entry.

What the check itself achieves is a separate theorem: the engine's enclosure settles an entry
whenever `x · y` lies at least `2B` from every rounding boundary (`Ozaki.roundEnclosure_of_margin`,
`Ozaki.ozaki1Enclosure_settles`). On the test matrices:

* Ozaki-I settles every Z3 entry with four slices and all but two with three;
* Ozaki-II with the Z3 models' four moduli (`P = 22`) settles none, five moduli settle 21 of 32,
  six settle all;
* ADP settles every entry at the configuration its own ESC rule picks for the two random binary64
  cases (`8` and `11` slices), and fewer with fewer slices.

Every variant rounds with IEEE's round to nearest even, on both vendors. The check runs on exact
values, never on a Tensor Core, whose output is not monotone in its inputs (TC-EFT's
non-monotonicity theorems).

**Signed zeros.** IEEE formats have two zeros, rationals one. The specification `Ozaki.crSigned`
is IEEE's: a nonzero exact sum that rounds to zero keeps its sign, and an exact zero is `−0` only
when every product is `−0`. The signed check takes the sign of a zero result from the enclosure
when it lies on one side of zero, and otherwise from the exact path; correctly rounded Ozaki-I
with a window accumulator returns `crSigned` on both vendors, in binary32 and FP64
(`Ozaki.ozaki1CRWS_eq`, `Ozaki.TC.tcOzaki1CRDS_eq`, `Ozaki.MC.mcOzaki1CRDS_eq`).

**IEEE special values.** On IEEE data (finite with a sign bit, `±Inf`, NaN) the specification
`Ozaki.dotIEEE` is the exact dot product rounded once: NaN for a NaN input, `Inf · 0` or opposite
infinities, `±Inf` for an infinite product or an overflowing sum, and IEEE's zero sign. IEEE 754
leaves a dot product's order and precision to the implementation; this is the "exact, then round
once" reading. A wrapper handles the special inputs and takes the sign of an overflowing sum from
the exact path's integer terms; with it every correctly rounded scheme meets the specification for
every input (`Ozaki.crIEEE_eq`, `Ozaki.TC.tcOzaki1CRDI_eq`, `Ozaki.MC.mcOzaki2CRDI_eq` and the
others in [THEOREMS.md](THEOREMS.md#long-dot-products-fp64-and-binary-formats)). Native GEMM and
plain Ozaki-I and Ozaki-II run with IEEE operations and agree with the rational schemes whenever
those are finite (`Ozaki.nativeDotIEEE_fin`, `Ozaki.ozaki1IEEE_fin`).

## On the Tensor Core model

The Tensor Core aligns every product to the group's largest exponent, keeps `F` bits below it
(`F = 23` on V100, `24` on A100, `25` on H100), adds exactly, and truncates to binary32. For
integer operands this loses nothing when `2b ≤ F` and `|c| + Σ|aᵢbᵢ| ≤ 2^24`
(`Ozaki.TC.evalBlock_int`), also across chained groups (`Ozaki.TC.runBlocks_int`). With fp16 or
tf32 operands `b = 11`, with bf16 `b = 8`, and every path satisfies `2b ≤ F`
(`Ozaki.TC.v100_exactOn` and seven more). The Z3 models' `4 × 4` configuration therefore runs
exactly on V100: four `11`-bit slices for Ozaki-I, moduli `{4096, 4095, 4093, 4091}` with `P = 22`
for Ozaki-II (`Ozaki.TC.v100_ozaki1_z3`, `Ozaki.TC.v100_ozaki2_z3`). On the Z3 models' own test
matrices the Lean pipelines return the same binary32 words as the Z3 models on all six fp16 and
tf32 paths ([tests](tests/README.md)).

What changes from the Z3 models:

* **The budget comes from the output, not the accumulator.** The Z3 engine rounds every partial
  sum to binary32; the Tensor Core adds a group exactly and rounds once. On the Tensor Core only
  the final sum must fit binary32: an A100 group is exact on products whose binary32 running sum
  is not (`Ozaki.TC.a100_exact_where_binary32_is_not`).
* **Full groups on A100 and H100 exceed the budget.** With `11`-bit slices, `k · 2^22 ≤ 2^24`
  allows four products; A100 and H100 groups take eight and sixteen, and seven products `2047²`
  already lose a bit (`Ozaki.TC.a100_full_group`). Split-K with chunks of four, `10`-bit slices,
  or at most four nonzero products per group restore exactness.
* **Two passes recover a full group exactly (a TC-EFT technique).** Run the group once from
  `c = 0`, giving `D1`, the truncation of the exact sum `S`; run it again from `c = −D1`. Because
  `c` takes part in alignment (the mechanism behind TC-EFT's non-monotonicity), the second pass is
  exact as long as `|D1| ≤ 2^(F+1)`, and it returns `S − D1`, so `D1 + D2 = S`
  (`Ozaki.TC.twoPass_exact`). `F` grows by one bit each time the group size doubles, so a full
  group of `11`-bit products always fits: `8 · 2^22 = 2^25` on A100, `16 · 2^22 = 2^26` on H100.
  The two-pass engine is exact for every length on all eight paths, with full groups of `11`-bit
  slices on fp16 and tf32 and `8`-bit slices on bf16 (`Ozaki.TC.a100F16_exactOn2`,
  `Ozaki.TC.h100F16_exactOn2` and six more). It is the matrix-instruction analogue of TwoProdFMA.
  On H100 it needs half the Tensor Core calls of `11`-bit split-K with chunks of four, but
  `10`-bit slices that fill the group are cheaper still: one extra slice costs less than a second
  pass (below).
* **The exact condition, with cancellation.** A block of `b`-bit integers with `2b ≤ F` and
  `|c| < 2^(F+1)` returns the exact sum whenever that sum is a binary32 value, however large the
  products, and the condition on the sum is necessary (`Ozaki.TC.evalBlock_cancel`,
  `Ozaki.TC.evalBlock_exact_needs_binary32`): eight products `±2^22` on A100 return `0`. It is
  the precise boundary, not a scheduling rule, since the sums are known only after computing them.
* **The choice of slices, chunks and passes.** Every candidate configuration on every path is
  proved exact for every length, and a cost in engine blocks picks the cheapest
  (`Ozaki.TC.candidates_exact`, `Ozaki.TC.h100F16_best`). Wherever a group holds more than four
  products, `10`-bit slices that fill it win: on H100 fp16, FP64 at `k = 1024`, 1344 blocks
  against 3840 for `11`-bit chunks of four and 1920 for two passes. The conservative rule allows
  this configuration too; what the model adds is the proof, and the evidence that two passes do
  not pay by this count. The count is of model instructions, not time.
* **The σ-trick.** For a binary32 `a` with `|a| ≤ 2^(g+b)`, `b ≤ 21` and `−149 ≤ g ≤ 104`,
  `fl(fl(a + σ) − σ)` with IEEE binary32 addition is `a` rounded to the grid `2^g` and
  `fl(a − hi)` is exact
  (`Ozaki.TC.sigma_split`); the remainder is exact for every grid
  (`Ozaki.TC.finiteValue32_sub_round`). The Z3 lemma covers `|a| ≤ 1`. A split computed with
  binary32 operations equals the scheme's split when every grid lies in `[−149, 104]`
  (`Ozaki.TC.splitFrom32_eq`). Outside that range σ overflows (above about `2^115`) or the grid
  falls below binary32's (the long exact paths reach grids far below `2^-149`). Slicing with
  integer operations covers every grid: on significands and exponents it shifts, divides with
  round-half-even and compares, and it equals the scheme's split for every vector and grid
  (`Ozaki.splitInt_eq`). Its coefficients have at most `b + 1` bits, its significands never grow,
  and no division needs more than `p + 2` bits (`Ozaki.splitInt_width`,
  `Ozaki.split_binary32_int`, `Ozaki.split_binary64_int`).
* **INT8 engines as fixed-width registers.** ADP's engine is a 32-bit wrapping accumulator
  (TC-EFT's `machineAccumulate 32`) over exact integer products. Its result is the exact sum
  reduced modulo `2^32`, so it does not depend on the accumulation order, and a saturating
  register agrees with it on ADP's operands (`Ozaki.TC.int8Dot_any_order`,
  `Ozaki.TC.int8_wrap_sat_exact`); it is not validated against INT8 hardware. It is exact on byte
  operands within `2^31` and wraps at 16 bits
  (`Ozaki.TC.int8Dot_bytes`, `Ozaki.TC.int8Dot_16_wraps`), and Ozaki-I on it is one binary64
  rounding of the exact fixed-point product (`Ozaki.TC.int8Recombine_eq`, `Ozaki.TC.int8Ozaki_eq`).
* **The whole ADP routine.** `Ozaki.TC.adp` follows the Z3 model `adp.py` step by step: scan for
  non-finite inputs, matrix ESC, width, slice count, the speed heuristic, then emulation or native
  binary64. Whenever it returns values on normal or zero entries of matching shapes with
  `k · 2^14 < 2^31`, every entry meets Grade A on the emulated path and the native `γₖ` bound
  otherwise (`Ozaki.TC.adp_accuracy`). On the five cases recorded from the Z3 model it takes the
  same path and returns the same values, and every test-level check of the Z3 model that concerns
  ADP itself is a theorem or a kernel-checked test on the model's own inputs: decoding, the
  paper's remap example, the three slice encodings agreeing, ESC with block size `1`, the valid
  paths, emergent overflow, subnormal inputs and the zero policies (`Ozaki.TC.encodings_agree`,
  `Ozaki.TC.adp_finite_path`, `Ozaki.TC.emulEntry_none_iff`, and
  [THEOREMS.md](THEOREMS.md#the-adp-pipeline-on-the-int8-engine)). It returns values for finite inputs of matching shapes
  whose products are within range (`Ozaki.TC.adp_isSome`).
* **A guardrail for subnormal inputs.** `Ozaki.TC.adpSafe` adds one check to the routine: an input
  with a nonzero entry below `2^-1022` goes to native FP64. With it, Grade A holds with no
  normality hypothesis (`Ozaki.TC.adpSafe_accuracy`), the routine returns values for every finite
  input in range (`Ozaki.TC.adpSafe_isSome`), and on the five recorded Z3 cases it returns what
  `adp` returns.
* **Correctly rounded ADP-style slicing.** `adpCR` is correctly rounded fixed-point Ozaki-I on the
  INT8 engine with given `(s, W)`, not the ADP routine with its ESC and guardrails; its last resort
  is exact rational arithmetic. `adpCRE` runs every product on the INT8 engine, split into chunks
  so that INT32 never wraps, including its exact path (all slice products of `6`-bit slices), and
  is correctly rounded for binary64 inputs of any length (`Ozaki.TC.adpCRE_eq`).

## On the matrix-core model

A CDNA block computes `S_acc` by one of three configurations and rounds it once to binary32 with
round to nearest: CDNA 1 sums exactly, CDNA 2 rounds a pairwise tree of binary32 products and
flushes subnormals, and CDNA 3 aligns the products to `24` fractional bits and adds `c` late with
two rounding-down steps. For integer operands and an integer `c` with `|c| + Σ|aᵢbᵢ| ≤ 2^24`, all
three return `c + Σ aᵢbᵢ` exactly (`Ozaki.MC.evalBlock_int`), across chained blocks and inner
products of any length (`Ozaki.MC.runBlocks_int`, `Ozaki.MC.dotBits_int`). The engine is exact on
the binary32 SFMA (`b ≤ 24`), CDNA 1, 2 and 3 fp16 and CDNA 3 XF32 (`b ≤ 11`), and the bf16 paths
(`b ≤ 8`) (`Ozaki.MC.cdna3F16_exactEngine` and the others in
[`OzakiMC/Profiles.lean`](OzakiMC/Profiles.lean)); CDNA 3's fp8 paths are not covered.

On the Z3 models' test matrices, every path with `11`-bit slices returns the Z3 models' binary32
words for both schemes ([tests](tests/README.md)). The binary32 SFMA, which rounds after every
product, is the Z3 models' engine: binary32 products accumulated with round to nearest.

What the model shows:

* **The same budget as on the Tensor Core.** Alignment never loses bits of integer products within
  `2^24`; the bound is set by the binary32 output.
* **bf16 paths need `8`-bit slices**: bf16 holds `256` but not `2047`
  (`Ozaki.MC.bfloat16_holds_256`).
* **A full CDNA 3 group of `11`-bit products exceeds the budget**: seven products `2047²` total
  `29331463`, which the final round to nearest returns as `29331464`, where the Tensor Core,
  which truncates, returns `29331462` (`Ozaki.MC.cdna3F16_full_group`).
* **The fp16 paths are exact where the SFMA is not**: products `5 × 2047², 1, −2 × 2047²` give the
  exact `12570628` on CDNA 1, 2 and 3 fp16, and `12570626` on the SFMA
  (`Ozaki.MC.fp16_exact_where_sfma_is_not`).
* **CDNA 2 does not round inside an Ozaki block.** Four products of `11`-bit integers total at
  most `2^24`, so every node of the pairwise tree is exact (`Ozaki.MC.pairTree_int`).
* **Cancellation differs by architecture.** CDNA 1 and CDNA 3 return the exact sum whenever every
  product, `c` and the sum are within `2^24`; CDNA 2 also needs every node of its pairwise tree
  within `2^24` (`Ozaki.MC.evalBlock_cancel`, `Ozaki.MC.pairTree_cancel`). On CDNA 3 fp16,
  `10`-bit slices are the cheapest exact configuration (`Ozaki.MC.cdna3F16_best`).

## Findings from formalizing

* The Ozaki-I error has a closed form: pairing slice `t` of `x` with the residual of `y` after
  `s − t` slices gives the exact identity behind the bound above, without enumerating the omitted
  slice pairs.
* At `P = 23` the Z3 counterexample to CRT reconstruction is `c = M` itself, whose residues are
  all zero (`Ozaki.crt_fails_at_23`).
* The ESC coarsening theorem holds for every block size, and its funnel bound does not need the
  Z3 query's assumption `e_a + e_b ≤ F` (`Ozaki.ADP.coarseEst_le`, `Ozaki.ADP.funnel`).
* Grade A needs no `u²` term: full fidelity makes the largest product exact, so each product's
  fixed-point error is at most `2^(F−52)`, half what the Z3 check allows (`Ozaki.ADP.term_bound`).
* **ADP's guarantee needs normal inputs.** With a subnormal entry, `x = [2^-1074, 2^-1023 × 7]`
  and `y = [1, −2^-60 × 7]`, the Lean model of ADP takes its emulated path and returns `−2^-1074`
  for a positive exact product, breaking Grade A even with its underflow term; the exponent clamp
  at `−1022` lets `2^F` exceed the dominant product by up to `2^52`. The unmodified Z3 model fails
  its own final-rounding check `[R.2]` on the same input. No guardrail of the routine catches it;
  one more does (`Ozaki.TC.adpSafe`). This concerns the routine as the ADP paper describes it,
  which the paper and the cuBLAS documentation say is accurate for subnormal values too; shipping
  cuBLAS is not modelled, and it passes an independent underflow test (Demmel et al., 2026) by
  detecting the wide range and using its FP64 path, much as `adpSafe` does.
* **ADP's zero policy matters for the result, not only the estimate.** Without the Z3 model's
  `[X.4]` assertion, the "skip zeros" policy returns `0` for a nonzero entry on one of the model's
  own inputs, breaking Grade A (`Ozaki.TC.adpPolicy_negInf` and kernel tests).
* Correct rounding is cheap where a scheme already carries margin: the Z3 configuration's fourth
  Ozaki-I slice, which adds nothing at binary32 output precision, lets the check settle every
  entry, and ADP's own ESC choice settles every entry of the random binary64 tests. Ozaki-II with
  `P = 22` carries no margin: none of its results on the Z3 matrices is correctly rounded.

## Scope

The proofs concern the models. That GPUs behave like them rests on the validation of `TensorCore`
and `MatrixCore`. As in the Z3 models, the CRT residues and reconstruction are exact integer
arithmetic; Ozaki-I's power-of-two rescaling is proved exact when its exponent is in range
(`Ozaki.TC.scaled_slice_product_exact`). Not covered: FP8 paths, and INT8 hardware semantics,
which are out of scope for now on both vendors
([issue #2](https://github.com/pauljiang03/TC-EFT/issues/2)): ADP runs on an idealized INT8
engine. [THEOREMS.md](THEOREMS.md#not-proved) lists the rest.
