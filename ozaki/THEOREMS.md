# What is proven

This page lists the main results that Lean has checked, in plain language, with the label of the
matching check in the Z3 models where there is one
(`[Z.n]` for a Z3 proof, other labels for runtime assertions). Labels refer to `ozaki1/` in the
Ozaki-I sections, `ozaki2/` in the Ozaki-II sections, and `ozaki-NVIDIA/` in the ADP section; in
the hardware sections they carry a prefix `I:`, `II:` or `ADP:`. The linked file has the exact
statement and every assumption. Every theorem depends only on Lean's standard axioms (`propext`,
`Classical.choice`, `Quot.sound`); both test libraries audit this.

A Z3 runtime assertion checks one fact on the test matrices; the Lean theorem states it for every
input. A Z3 lemma is proved for one format or exponent range; the Lean theorem is stated for the
general case where that costs nothing.

Several sections go beyond the Z3 models: [correct rounding](#correct-rounding), with its
[fixed-width integer arithmetic](#fixed-width-integer-arithmetic) and
[IEEE special values](#ieee-rounding-special-values-and-signed-zeros);
[long dot products, FP64 and error bounds](#long-dot-products-fp64-and-error-bounds); and the
[ADP pipeline](#the-adp-pipeline-on-the-int8-engine) with its Grade-A guarantee. The
[last section](#not-proved) lists what is not proved.

## The schemes, independent of the hardware

### Ozaki-I: slicing

### ADP and ESC (INT8 engines)

| The unsigned-slice remap reconstructs every integer. | `[U.5]` | `Ozaki.ADP.remap_value` | [Ozaki/ADP.lean](Ozaki/ADP.lean) |
| Remapped slices are signed bytes exactly on `[−128 (256^s − 1)/255, 127 (256^s − 1)/255]`. | `[Z.3]` | `Ozaki.ADP.remap_s8` | [Ozaki/ADP.lean](Ozaki/ADP.lean) |
| A remapped digit keeps the unsigned digit's bit pattern. | `[Z.5]` | `Ozaki.ADP.remap_bit_pattern` | [Ozaki/ADP.lean](Ozaki/ADP.lean) |
| The remap range is smaller than the prototype's: `2^23 − 129` fits three floor/u8 slices but not three remapped ones. | `[Z.4]` | `Ozaki.ADP.remap_range_smaller` | [Ozaki/ADP.lean](Ozaki/ADP.lean) |
| `53`-bit integers need `8` naive signed slices and `7` remapped ones. | `[T.3]` | `Ozaki.ADP.slices_53` | [Ozaki/ADP.lean](Ozaki/ADP.lean) |
| The naive signed-byte encoding: for `\|N\| < 128^s` its digits lie in `[−127, 127]` and `Σ dₜ 128^t = N`; a width that fits naive slices fits remapped ones. | `[U.6]`, `[T.3]` | `Ozaki.ADP.naiveDigits_s8`, `Ozaki.ADP.naiveFits_remapFits` | [Ozaki/ADPEncodings.lean](Ozaki/ADPEncodings.lean) |
| The three encodings (remap, floor/u8, naive s8): each has `s` digits of magnitude at most `255` and reconstructs every integer in its range, and the slice products of any of them, weighted by its base, add up to the fixed-point product. | `[T.4]` | `Ozaki.ADP.SliceEncoding.digits_value`, `Ozaki.ADP.SliceEncoding.digits_natAbs_le`, `Ozaki.ADP.slice_recombination_with` | [Ozaki/ADPEncodings.lean](Ozaki/ADPEncodings.lean) |
| The paper's remap example: floor digits `[200, 123]` become `[−56, 124]`, and `−56` has the bit pattern of `200`. | `[T.2]` | `Ozaki.ADP.paper_remap_example` | [Ozaki/ADPEncodings.lean](Ozaki/ADPEncodings.lean) |
| With block size `1` the coarsened estimate is the exact one, so the coarsened ESC is the exact ESC. | `[T.5]` | `Ozaki.ADP.coarseEst_one`, `Ozaki.ADP.escCoarse_one` | [Ozaki/ADPEncodings.lean](Ozaki/ADPEncodings.lean) |
| On the Z3 model's own zero-policy rows, skipping zeros or giving them exponent `−1022` violates `[X.4]`, and the `−∞` policy does not. | `[T.12]` | `Ozaki.ADP.zeros_case_caught`, `Ozaki.ADP.field0_case_caught` | [Ozaki/ADPEncodings.lean](Ozaki/ADPEncodings.lean) |

| `\|ab − ãb̃\| ≤ δa\|b\| + \|ã\|δb`; with the `+1` each half is at most `2^(F−52)`, and without it that fails. | `[Z.10]`–`[Z.12]` | `Ozaki.ADP.term_error`, `Ozaki.ADP.funnel`, `Ozaki.ADP.funnel_needs_plus_one` | [Ozaki/ADP.lean](Ozaki/ADP.lean) |
| The `s²` slice products, weighted by `256^(t+u)`, add up to the fixed-point product. | `[R.1]` | `Ozaki.ADP.slice_recombination` | [Ozaki/ADP.lean](Ozaki/ADP.lean) |
| Floor digits: the low digits are unsigned bytes, the lead digit a signed byte, and they reconstruct `N`. | `[U.1]`, `[U.2]` | `Ozaki.ADP.floorDigits_bytes`, `Ozaki.ADP.floorDigits_value` | [Ozaki/ADPError.lean](Ozaki/ADPError.lean) |
| A nonzero binary64 value lies in `[2^e, 2^(e+1))` for its exponent `e` (normals). | `[D.2]` | `Ozaki.ADP.abs_lt_exp64`, `Ozaki.ADP.exp64_le_abs` | [Ozaki/ADPError.lean](Ozaki/ADPError.lean) |
| Fixed point: `0 ≤ a 2^s − N < 1`, `N ∈ [−2^W, 2^W)`, and on-grid entries convert exactly. | `[F.1]`, `[F.2]` | `Ozaki.ADP.fixed_floor`, `Ozaki.ADP.fixed_range`, `Ozaki.ADP.fixed_exact` | [Ozaki/ADPError.lean](Ozaki/ADPError.lean) |

| **Grade A.** After one rounding, `\|C − x · y\| ≤ (4k + 1) 2^-53 Σ\|xᵢyᵢ\| + η`, for normal or zero entries and `2ku ≤ 1`. Subnormal entries can violate it (see the README's findings). | `[P.2]` | `Ozaki.ADP.emulated_gradeA` | [Ozaki/ADPError.lean](Ozaki/ADPError.lean) |

## Correct rounding

Each scheme holds an exact value `H` before its last rounding and a proved bound `B ≥ |x · y − H|`.
If `H − B` and `H + B` round to the same value, so does `x · y`; otherwise more slices or moduli are
tried, then an exact path. No Z3 model has a counterpart. `ozaki1CR` and `ozaki2CR` fall back to the
exact rational `x · y`, so their theorems would hold without the engine; the `CRE` variants take the
exact path on the engine. The monotonicity of rounding to nearest is classical (Flocq's
`Rnd_N_pt_monotone`); it is proved here for the framework.

### The check and the exact path

| What it says | Lean name | File |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Rounding to nearest is monotone; this needs only that results are nearest values, not the tie rule. | `Ozaki.round_monotone` | [Ozaki/Correct.lean](Ozaki/Correct.lean) |
| If `\|v − H\| ≤ B` and both `H ± B` round to `w`, then `v` rounds to `w`. | `Ozaki.round_eq_of_enclosure` | [Ozaki/Correct.lean](Ozaki/Correct.lean) |
| Trying enclosures in turn and then the exact value returns the rounding of the exact value. | `Ozaki.certify_eq` | [Ozaki/Correct.lean](Ozaki/Correct.lean) |
| `\|x · y − x' · y'\| ≤ max\|x − x'\| Σ\|y\| + max\|y − y'\| Σ\|x'\|`. | `Ozaki.dot_approx_error` | [Ozaki/Correct.lean](Ozaki/Correct.lean) |
| Ozaki-I and Ozaki-II, correctly rounded, on any engine exact on their slices or residues. | `Ozaki.ozaki1CR_eq`, `Ozaki.ozaki2CR_eq` | [Ozaki/Correct.lean](Ozaki/Correct.lean) |
| Inputs on a grid `2^m` leave nothing over once the slicing bound is below `2^m`; with nothing left over, Ozaki-I with all `s²` slice products is exact. | `Ozaki.split_residual_zero`, `Ozaki.ozaki1Full_eq` | [Ozaki/Correct.lean](Ozaki/Correct.lean) |
| Correctly rounded Ozaki-I and Ozaki-II whose exact path also runs on the engine (Ozaki-I with all `s²` slice products). | `Ozaki.ozaki1CRE_eq`, `Ozaki.ozaki2CRE_eq` | [Ozaki/Correct.lean](Ozaki/Correct.lean) |
| **What the check achieves:** an enclosure settles an entry whenever `x · y` is `2B` from every rounding boundary; for Ozaki-I with its slicing bound. | `Ozaki.roundEnclosure_of_margin`, `Ozaki.ozaki1Enclosure_settles` | [Ozaki/Correct.lean](Ozaki/Correct.lean) |
| **Exact zeros settle at once.** The slicing bound counts only the positions where both entries are nonzero, never more than the normwise bound; the count is `0` exactly when every product is zero, and it is one exact engine dot product of 0/1 vectors. With it, an entry whose products are all zero settles on the first check with `0` (and IEEE's zero sign), whatever the later checks or the fallback would return; rational, window and fixed-width versions, on both vendors. | `Ozaki.exactTerms_error_overlap`, `Ozaki.supportOverlap_eq_zero_iff`, `Ozaki.overlapEng_eq`, `Ozaki.windowSum_error_nonzero`, `Ozaki.ozaki1CREZ_eq`, `Ozaki.ozaki1CRWZ_eq`, `Ozaki.ozaki1CheckBZ_eq`, `Ozaki.ozaki1CREZ_zero`, `Ozaki.ozaki1CRWSZ_eq`, `Ozaki.ozaki1CRWSZ_zero`, `Ozaki.TC.tcOzaki1CRDZ_eq`, `Ozaki.TC.tcOzaki1CRBDZ_eq`, `Ozaki.TC.tcOzaki1CRDSZ_eq`, `Ozaki.MC.mcOzaki1CRDZ_eq` | [Ozaki/ZeroCheck.lean](Ozaki/ZeroCheck.lean), [OzakiTC/ZeroCheck.lean](OzakiTC/ZeroCheck.lean), [OzakiMC/ZeroCheck.lean](OzakiMC/ZeroCheck.lean) |

### Fixed-width integer arithmetic

Everything after the engine also runs in integer registers whose widths do not depend on the
inputs' exponents, and each integer form is proved equal to its rational counterpart.

| What it says | Lean name | File |
| --- | --- | --- |
| **Slicing with integer operations, for every grid.** A binary vector given as significands and exponents `(m, e)` is sliced with integer shifts, a round-half-even division and exponent arithmetic, and the result equals the scheme's split for every vector, slice count and grid. Every coefficient is at most `2^b`, the remaining significands never grow (below `2^24` for binary32, `2^53` for binary64), and a division never needs more than `p + 2` bits: the widths depend on the format and `b`, never on the exponents. | `Ozaki.rneShift_eq`, `Ozaki.gridInt_eq`, `Ozaki.coeffInt_eq`, `Ozaki.splitInt_eq`, `Ozaki.splitInt_width`, `Ozaki.shiftPow_le`, `Ozaki.split_binary32_int`, `Ozaki.split_binary64_int` | [Ozaki/SliceInt.lean](Ozaki/SliceInt.lean) |
| **The exact sum's register** (needed only by an exact path that adds the slice products exactly; the bounded one below does not): for inputs on a grid `2^m` the exact slice sum is `N · 2^(2(m−b))` with `\|N\| ≤ (s(s+1)/2) k 2^(E+F−2(m−b))`; for binary32 and `11`-bit slices about `580` bits. | `Ozaki.exactTerms_sum_register`, `Ozaki.exactTerms_sum_register32` | [Ozaki/Width.lean](Ozaki/Width.lean), [Ozaki/Exact64.lean](Ozaki/Exact64.lean) |
| **A two-word accumulator suffices for the check.** Each scaled slice product rounded down to a `W`-bit window and added exactly: within `n 2^q` of the exact sum, an integer multiple of `2^q` with `\|N\| ≤ (s(s+1)/2)(k 2^W + 1)`; correct rounding holds with it, on both vendors, for binary32 and FP64. | `Ozaki.windowSum_error`, `Ozaki.ozaki1CRW_eq`, `Ozaki.ozaki1Window_register`, `Ozaki.ozaki1WindowEnclosure_settles`, `Ozaki.TC.tcOzaki1CRDW_eq`, `Ozaki.TC.tcOzaki1CRLW_eq`, `Ozaki.TC.v100_fp64CRW`, `Ozaki.MC.mcOzaki1CRDW_eq`, `Ozaki.MC.mcOzaki1CRLW_eq` | [Ozaki/Window.lean](Ozaki/Window.lean), [OzakiTC/LongDot.lean](OzakiTC/LongDot.lean), [OzakiMC/LongDot.lean](OzakiMC/LongDot.lean) |
| **Bounded registers.** A `w`-bit two's-complement register adds a list exactly when the magnitudes total less than `2^(w−1)`. Round to nearest even of `N 2^q` by a few integer comparisons, for every `N` and `q`. The sign and the round to nearest even of a sum of terms `v 2^e` by a top-down descent over windows of `W` bits, with ties, underflow and overflow, whenever `W > bitlen(n + 1) + p + 3`; the descent visits at most `E − m + 1` windows. | `Ozaki.fixedSum_eq`, `Ozaki.fixedSum_natAbs_le`, `Ozaki.roundExact_eq`, `Ozaki.roundByCmp_spec`, `Ozaki.signSum_eq`, `Ozaki.roundSum_eq`, `Ozaki.descend_sound`, `Ozaki.descend_parts_lt`, `Ozaki.query_natAbs_lt`, `Ozaki.descendAll_fuel_le` | [Ozaki/Bounded.lean](Ozaki/Bounded.lean), [Ozaki/SignOracle.lean](Ozaki/SignOracle.lean) |
| **Correctly rounded Ozaki-I in bounded integer arithmetic.** The check on a window sum in a register of `W + bitlen(n(k+2)) + 1` bits that never wraps, the exact path by the descent with windows of `bitlen(s² + 1) + p + 4` bits over terms at most the engine's budget, and the final rounding by comparisons. Each equals its rational counterpart, so the scheme is correctly rounded, on both vendors, for binary32 and FP64 inputs of any length. | `Ozaki.ozaki1CheckB_eq`, `Ozaki.ozaki1CheckB_register`, `Ozaki.ozaki1ExactPathB_eq`, `Ozaki.ozaki1ExactPathB_terms`, `Ozaki.ozaki1CRB_eq_CRW`, `Ozaki.ozaki1CRB_eq`, `Ozaki.ozaki1CRB64_eq`, `Ozaki.ozaki1CRB32_eq`, `Ozaki.TC.tcOzaki1CRBD_eq`, `Ozaki.TC.tcOzaki1CRBL_eq`, `Ozaki.TC.v100_fp64CRB`, `Ozaki.MC.mcOzaki1CRBD_eq`, `Ozaki.MC.mcOzaki1CRBL_eq` | [Ozaki/BoundedOzaki.lean](Ozaki/BoundedOzaki.lean), [OzakiTC/Bounded.lean](OzakiTC/Bounded.lean), [OzakiMC/Bounded.lean](OzakiMC/Bounded.lean) |
| **A descent that jumps empty gaps.** The exact path's descent starts each window at the top of the largest remaining term, decides the sign and the round to nearest even of the sum as before, and visits at most `n · bitlen(max \|v\|) + 1` windows, whatever the exponents. | `Ozaki.descendJ_sound`, `Ozaki.signSumJ_eq`, `Ozaki.roundSumJ_eq`, `Ozaki.windowsJ_le`, `Ozaki.exactPath_windows` | [Ozaki/Descent.lean](Ozaki/Descent.lean), [Ozaki/BoundedOzaki2J.lean](Ozaki/BoundedOzaki2J.lean) |
| **Correctly rounded Ozaki-I as one integer function**, from `(significand, exponent)` inputs: integer slicing, the engine, the integer check, the jumping exact path and the final rounding; equal to the bounded scheme, correctly rounded for binary32 and binary64 inputs, with IEEE signed zeros, on both vendors. | `Ozaki.ozaki1CRI_eq_CRB`, `Ozaki.ozaki1CRI_eq`, `Ozaki.ozaki1CRI64_eq`, `Ozaki.ozaki1CRI32_eq`, `Ozaki.ozaki1CRIS_eq`, `Ozaki.TC.tcOzaki1CRID_eq`, `Ozaki.TC.v100_fp64CRI`, `Ozaki.MC.mcOzaki1CRID_eq` | [Ozaki/BoundedInt.lean](Ozaki/BoundedInt.lean), [OzakiTC/Bounded.lean](OzakiTC/Bounded.lean), [OzakiMC/Bounded.lean](OzakiMC/Bounded.lean) |
| **Integer checks for Ozaki-II and ADP.** The enclosure as `(N, q, K, q)`: `N` the CRT result or the recombined fixed-point product, and `K` a bound built from the scaled integers the engine already multiplies; the integer test equals the rational one, and the schemes with it are correctly rounded.

### IEEE rounding, special values and signed zeros

| What it says | Lean name | File |
| --- | --- | --- |
| A hardware-independent IEEE round to nearest even for any binary format, with IEEE overflow: nearest, succeeds on intervals, error `2^-p\|q\| + 2^(emin−p)`. Instances `rne32Q` and `rne64`. | `Ozaki.roundRNE_nearest`, `Ozaki.roundRNE_intervals`, `Ozaki.roundRNE_within`, `Ozaki.rne64_nearest`, `Ozaki.rne32Q_nearest` | [Ozaki/Binary.lean](Ozaki/Binary.lean) |
| TensorCore's and MatrixCore's binary32 values, and TensorCore's binary64 values, are those of `Ozaki.Binary`. | `Ozaki.TC.finiteValue32_binary32`, `Ozaki.TC.fp64_binary64`, `Ozaki.MC.finiteValue32_binary32` | [OzakiTC/Rounding.lean](OzakiTC/Rounding.lean), [OzakiTC/LongDot.lean](OzakiTC/LongDot.lean), [OzakiMC/LongDot.lean](OzakiMC/LongDot.lean) |
| **One rounding on both vendors.** Every scheme rounds with IEEE's round to nearest even. TensorCore's binary32 and binary64 roundings compute the same value (the same exponent, grid and ties-to-even step) and differ only in overflow: they return no result above the largest finite value, where IEEE rounds values within half an ulp of it down to it. So they agree with IEEE's up to the largest finite value, and every result they return is IEEE's. MatrixCore's binary32 rounding is IEEE's on every input. | `Ozaki.TC.signedRounded_eq_rneU`, `Ozaki.TC.round32ValueTC_eq`, `Ozaki.TC.add32_of_fp32Add`, `Ozaki.TC.binarySignedRounded_eq_rneU`, `Ozaki.TC.fp64RoundTC_eq`, `Ozaki.TC.fp64Round_of_TC`, `Ozaki.MC.rneValue_eq_rneU`, `Ozaki.MC.round32Value_eq_rne32Q` | [OzakiTC/Rounding.lean](OzakiTC/Rounding.lean), [OzakiTC/IEEE.lean](OzakiTC/IEEE.lean), [OzakiMC/IEEE.lean](OzakiMC/IEEE.lean) |
| **IEEE values and operations.** Data are finite values with a sign bit, `±Inf` or NaN. Round to nearest even is total: `±Inf` exactly when the rounded magnitude exceeds the largest finite value, a zero result keeps the sign of the exact value; multiplication and addition follow IEEE's table (`Inf · 0` and `Inf + (−Inf)` are NaN, NaN propagates, `x + (−x) = +0`, `(−0) + (−0) = −0`) and agree with `roundRNE` on finite results. | `Ozaki.roundF_of_some`, `Ozaki.roundF_eq_inf_iff`, `Ozaki.roundF_inFormat`, `Ozaki.mulF_inf_zero`, `Ozaki.addF_inf_neg`, `Ozaki.addF_neg_self`, `Ozaki.addF_negZero`, `Ozaki.addF_fin_val`, `Ozaki.mulF_fin_val` | [Ozaki/IEEEValue.lean](Ozaki/IEEEValue.lean) |
| **The IEEE correctly rounded dot product.** NaN if an input is NaN, a product is `Inf · 0`, or the products include `+Inf` and `−Inf`; else `±Inf` if a product is infinite; else the exact sum rounded once, `±Inf` on overflow, with IEEE's zero sign. IEEE 754 leaves a dot product's order and precision to the implementation; this is the "exact, then round once" reading. A wrapper that handles the special inputs and gets the sign of an overflowing sum from the exact path's integer terms turns any correctly rounded scheme into one that meets this specification for every input. | `Ozaki.dotIEEE`, `Ozaki.dotIEEE_fin`, `Ozaki.crIEEE_eq`, `Ozaki.crIEEE_exactSign`, `Ozaki.exactSignB_eq` | [Ozaki/IEEEDot.lean](Ozaki/IEEEDot.lean) |

| **Native GEMM, plain Ozaki-I and Ozaki-II with special values**: IEEE operations, `±Inf` on overflow, IEEE zero signs; on finite inputs they return the rational schemes' results whenever those are finite, so the error bounds apply. | `Ozaki.nativeDotIEEE_fin`, `Ozaki.ozaki1IEEE_fin`, `Ozaki.ozaki2IEEE_fin`, `Ozaki.TC.tcOzaki1I_fin`, `Ozaki.TC.tcOzaki2I_fin`, `Ozaki.TC.tcOzaki1DI_fin`, `Ozaki.MC.mcOzaki1I_fin`, `Ozaki.MC.mcOzaki2I_fin`, `Ozaki.MC.mcOzaki1DI_fin` | [Ozaki/IEEEDot.lean](Ozaki/IEEEDot.lean), [OzakiTC/IEEESchemes.lean](OzakiTC/IEEESchemes.lean), [OzakiMC/IEEESchemes.lean](OzakiMC/IEEESchemes.lean) |
| **Signed zeros.** The specification is IEEE's: the correctly rounded sum, `−0` when a nonzero exact sum rounds to zero from below, and for an exact zero `−0` only when every product is `−0`. The signed check settles the sign from the enclosure when it lies on one side of zero, and otherwise from the exact path; correctly rounded Ozaki-I with a window accumulator returns the specified signed value on both vendors, for binary32 and FP64. | `Ozaki.certifySigned_eq`, `Ozaki.ozaki1CRWS_eq`, `Ozaki.TC.tcOzaki1CRDS_eq`, `Ozaki.TC.tcOzaki1CRLS_eq`, `Ozaki.MC.mcOzaki1CRDS_eq`, `Ozaki.MC.mcOzaki1CRLS_eq` | [Ozaki/SignedZero.lean](Ozaki/SignedZero.lean), [OzakiTC/Signed.lean](OzakiTC/Signed.lean), [OzakiMC/Signed.lean](OzakiMC/Signed.lean) |

### The ADP pipeline on the INT8 engine

`Ozaki.TC.adp` is the routine of the Z3 model `adp.py`, in its order: scan for non-finite inputs,
matrix ESC (unbounded sends the product to native binary64), `W = 53 + ESC + 1`, the slice count,
the heuristic `s² ≤ ratio`, then emulation on TC-EFT's INT8 engine, or native binary64 otherwise. On
the five cases recorded from the unmodified Z3 model (three emulated, one sent to native binary64 by
its ESC, one non-finite) it returns the same path and values ([tests](tests/README.md)).

| What it says | Z3 | Lean name |
| --- | --- | --- |
| A binary64 word is `m 2^(e−52)` with `\|m\| < 2^53`, and `\|v\| < 2^(e+1)`. | `ADP:[D.1]`–`ADP:[D.3]` | `Ozaki.TC.value64_onGrid`, `Ozaki.TC.value64_bound` |
| Binary64 round to nearest (IEEE's): `\|fl(q) − q\| ≤ 2^-53 \|q\| + 2^-1075`; it fails exactly when the rounded magnitude exceeds the largest finite value, as in IEEE. | `ADP:[R.2]` | `Ozaki.TC.fp64Round_within`, `Ozaki.TC.fp64Round_none_iff` |
| `W = 53 + ESC + 1`, and the slice count is the least that holds `W` bits. | `ADP:[B.1]`, `ADP:[B.2]` | `Ozaki.TC.adpWidth`, `Ozaki.TC.slicesNeeded_spec` |
| The matrix ESC is at least every entry's ESC. | `ADP:[X.6]` | `Ozaki.TC.matrixEsc_ge` |
| A slice is an 8-bit pattern; one emulated entry is the binary64 rounding of the fixed-point product. | `ADP:[E.1]`, `ADP:[E.3]`, `ADP:[R.1]` | `Ozaki.TC.int8_pattern`, `Ozaki.TC.emulEntry_eq` |
| An emulated entry meets P.1 and Grade A; a native entry meets the `γₖ` bound. | `ADP:[P.1]`, `ADP:[P.2]`, `ADP:[N.1]` | `Ozaki.TC.emulEntry_P1`, `Ozaki.TC.emulEntry_gradeA`, `Ozaki.TC.nativeEntry_error` |
| The guardrails: non-finite inputs go to the native path, and emulation runs only on finite inputs with a finite ESC and `s² ≤ ratio`. | `ADP:[G.1]`–`ADP:[G.3]` | `Ozaki.TC.adp_nonfinite_iff`, `Ozaki.TC.adp_emulated` |
| **The whole routine.** Whenever `adp` returns values, on normal or zero entries of matching shapes with `k · 2^14 < 2^31`, every entry meets Grade A on the emulated path and the `γₖ` bound on the native path. | `ADP:[P.2]`, `ADP:[N.1]` | `Ozaki.TC.adp_accuracy` |
| Both zeros decode to `0` with exponent `−∞`. | `ADP:[T.1]` | `Ozaki.TC.decode_zeros` |
| **The encodings agree.** The routine with any of the three slice encodings, each with its own minimal slice count, returns one binary64 rounding of the same fixed-point product, so two encodings that both emulate return the same values (with `k · 2^16 < 2^31`, the Z3 model's static bound). | `ADP:[T.4]`, `ADP:[B.2]` | `Ozaki.TC.emulEntryWith_eq`, `Ozaki.TC.encodings_agree`, `Ozaki.TC.adpWith_remap`, `Ozaki.TC.adpWith_encodings_agree`, `Ozaki.TC.slicesNeededWith_spec`, `Ozaki.TC.slicesNeeded_le_naive` |
| Finite inputs take the emulated or the native-slow path; with a subnormal entry `adpSafe` takes the native path. | `ADP:[T.7]`, `ADP:[T.11]` | `Ozaki.TC.adp_finite_path`, `Ozaki.TC.adpSafe_subnormal` |
| **Emergent overflow.** An emulated entry fails exactly when the rounded fixed-point product exceeds the largest finite binary64 value; where the Z3 model returns `±Inf`, `adp` returns no values and `adpIEEE` returns `±Inf`. | `ADP:[T.10]` | `Ozaki.TC.emulEntry_none_iff` |
| **ADP with special values.** Words decode to IEEE data exactly as IEEE classifies them; `adpIEEE` takes `adp`'s path and returns its values wherever `adp` returns values, its non-finite path is native FP64 with IEEE operations, and on the Z3 model's cases with an infinity, a NaN and an emulated overflow it returns the Z3 model's words, class for class. | `ADP:[T.9]`, `ADP:[T.10]` | `Ozaki.TC.decodeF64_inf_iff`, `Ozaki.TC.decodeF64_nan_iff`, `Ozaki.TC.adpIEEE_agrees`, `Ozaki.TC.adpIEEE_nonfinite`, `Ozaki.TC.adpSafeIEEE_agrees` |
| **A guardrail for subnormal inputs.** `adpSafe` sends inputs with a nonzero entry below `2^-1022` to the native path; whenever it emulates, every entry is normal or zero, and whenever it returns values, every entry meets Grade A on the emulated path and the `γₖ` bound on the native path, with no normality hypothesis. On the five recorded Z3 cases it returns what `adp` returns. | `ADP:[P.2]`, `ADP:[N.1]` | `Ozaki.TC.adpSafe_emulated_normal`, `Ozaki.TC.nativeGemm64_accuracy`, `Ozaki.TC.adpSafe_accuracy` |
| **The routine with the Z3 model's zero policies.** With the `−∞` policy it is `adp`; without the model's `[X.4]` assertion, the "skip zeros" policy returns `0` for a nonzero entry on the model's own `field0_case` input, breaking Grade A, and the `−1022` policy fails on a constructed input (kernel-checked on recorded inputs). | `ADP:[X.4]`, `ADP:[T.12]` | `Ozaki.TC.adpPolicy_negInf` |
| **The routine returns values** for finite inputs of matching shapes with `k · 2^14 < 2^31` and every `Σ\|xᵢyᵢ\| ≤ 2^1000` (a sufficient bound, not a sharp one); `adp` needs normal or zero entries, `adpSafe` does not. | | `Ozaki.TC.adp_isSome`, `Ozaki.TC.adpSafe_isSome` |
| **Correctly rounded fixed-point Ozaki-I as in ADP**: with given `(s, W)` that fit and `k · 2^14 < 2^31`, `adpCR` returns the binary64 round to nearest of `x · y` for every input; it falls back to the exact rational product, and it is not the ESC-driven routine. | | `Ozaki.TC.adpCR_eq` |
| **The same with every product on the INT8 engine, any length.** The INT8 engine with split-K is exact on `6`-bit slices for every length; the fixed-point enclosures run on it with split-K too; and the exact path is Ozaki-I with all slice products of `6`-bit slices on it, at most `smax` slices with `7 smax > 2098`. | | `Ozaki.TC.int8SplitK_exactOn`, `Ozaki.TC.int8DotK_exact`, `Ozaki.TC.adpEnclosureK_sound`, `Ozaki.TC.adpCRE_eq` |

All of these are in [OzakiTC/ADP.lean](OzakiTC/ADP.lean), except `adpCR_eq` in
[OzakiTC/Correct.lean](OzakiTC/Correct.lean), the guardrail, success and `adpCRE` results in
[OzakiTC/ADPFix.lean](OzakiTC/ADPFix.lean), the zero policies in
[OzakiTC/ADPZeroPolicy.lean](OzakiTC/ADPZeroPolicy.lean), and the test-level labels (`[T.1]`, `[T.4]`, `[T.7]`,
`[T.10]`, `[T.11]`) in [OzakiTC/ADPLabels.lean](OzakiTC/ADPLabels.lean). The Z3 model's inputs for
`[T.1]`, `[T.4]`, `[T.7]`, `[T.8]`, `[T.10]`, `[T.11]` and `[T.12]` are also checked by kernel
evaluation ([tests](tests/README.md)). `[T.13]` (fault injection) and `[T.14]` (label coverage)
check the Z3 model's own harness; their counterpart here is this page, where every label has a
theorem or a kernel-checked test.

## Not proved

- That real GPUs behave like the models; see TC-EFT's and Matrix-Core's validation.
- FP8 paths: CDNA 3's `odd_even_grouping`, and no FP8 Tensor Core path exists in `TensorCore`.
- INT8 hardware semantics are out of scope for now, on both vendors
  ([issue #2](https://github.com/pauljiang03/TC-EFT/issues/2)). ADP runs on an idealized INT8
  engine, the arithmetic of a wrapping (or saturating) INT32 register over exact integer products;
  its result does not depend on the accumulation order, but neither `TensorCore` nor `MatrixCore`
  models an INT8 instruction, and nothing is validated against INT8 hardware.
- The Z3 models' measured comparisons (`I:[M.2]`, `I:[M.3]`, `II:[M.2]`, `II:[M.3]`) are checked
  on their test matrices ([tests](tests/README.md)), not proved: they are not true for every input.
- ADP: the unsafe zero policies are checked on recorded and constructed inputs, not proved wrong
  in general. Grade A fails for some subnormal inputs of `adp` as the paper describes it; the extra
  guardrail of `adpSafe` restores it. cuBLAS's own implementation is not modelled; it passes an
  independent underflow test (Demmel et al., 2026).
- TensorCore's own binary32 and binary64 roundings fail above the largest finite value, where
  IEEE rounds values below `2^128 − 2^103` (binary64: `2^1024 − 2^970`) down to it. No result here
  depends on that: the schemes, the σ-trick and `int8Ozaki` all use IEEE's rounding.
- The width theorems leave some values unguarded: comparisons, signs, absolute values, bit
  lengths, list lengths and small counters; the CRT basis constants, which are read, not computed;
  the powers inside shifts, of which only the shifted results are guarded; and the engines' internal
  arithmetic, of which only the outputs are guarded. The widths are generous, not tight. The signed
  variants have no checked copies, and the special-value wrapper detects specials on decoded data,
  not by integer operations. ADP's integer pipeline exists on the Tensor Core side only.
- The binary32 σ-trick is proved only for grids in `[2^-149, 2^104]`; the integer slicing covers
  every grid.
- The cancellation condition is the exact boundary, not a scheduling rule: the running sums are
  known only after computing them. The slice-choice costs count engine blocks, not time.
- IEEE special values are modelled without NaN payloads or signalling NaNs. The rational functions
  (`Option ℚ`, `none` on overflow) remain the core of every proof; their IEEE counterparts are the
  `…I` functions above.

These blocks keep every name above connected to the actual API. `TensorCore` and `MatrixCore`
cannot be imported together, so there is one block for each model:
