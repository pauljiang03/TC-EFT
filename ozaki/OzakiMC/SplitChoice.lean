/-! # Choosing the slice width and chunk length per matrix-core path

The AMD analogue of `OzakiTC.SplitChoice`. On the matrix-core model one knob is proved exact:
split-K with `b`-bit slices, chunks of `chunkLen b = 2^(24 − 2b)` products, each chunk on chained
blocks of `N_FMA` products (`mcSplitK_exactOn`); there is no two-pass engine on this model. The
candidates are every `b` up to what the operand format holds with `2b ≤ 24`
(`mcCandidates_exact`), and the cost of Ozaki-I for `t` bits is `s(s+1)/2` slice products
(`s = slicesFor b t`, the rule of `Ozaki.SliceRule`) times `⌈chunk / N_FMA⌉` blocks per chunk. As
on the Tensor Core, the cost is in model blocks, not measured time.

## Results (inner dimension `k = 1024`)

| path | `N_FMA` | FP64 (`t = 53`): best | blocks | binary32 (`t = 24`): best | blocks |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| SFMA fp32 | 1 | `b = 12` | 15360 | `b = 12` | 6144 |
| CDNA 1 fp16 | 4 | `b = 11` | 3840 | `b = 11` | 1536 |
| CDNA 1 bf16 | 2 | `b = 8` | 14336 | `b = 8` | 5120 |
| CDNA 2 fp16 | 4 | `b = 11` | 3840 | `b = 11` | 1536 |
| CDNA 2 bf16 | 2 | `b = 8` | 14336 | `b = 8` | 5120 |
| CDNA 2 bf16 `_1k` | 4 | `b = 8` | 7168 | `b = 8` | 2560 |
| CDNA 3 fp16 | 8 | `b = 10` | 2688 | `b = 10` | 768 |
| CDNA 3 bf16 | 8 | `b = 8` | 3584 | `b = 8` | 1280 |
| CDNA 3 XF32 | 4 | `b = 11` | 3840 | `b = 11` | 1536 |

As on A100, CDNA 3 fp16's blocks of eight favour `10`-bit slices: `2688` blocks for FP64 against
`3840` with `11`-bit slices in chunks of four (`cdna3F16_best`). The SFMA multiplies one product per
block, so the widest slices it holds (`b = 12`, `2b ≤ 24`) are best. -/
