/-! # Where the conditions bind on AMD matrix cores

Kernel-checked evaluations of the matrix-core model that show the conditions of the exactness
theorems at work. Operand words are fp16 (`0x67FF = 2047`, `0x3C00 = 1`, `0xE7FF = −2047`) or
binary32 (`0x44FFE000 = 2047`, `0x3F800000 = 1`, `0xC4FFE000 = −2047`).

* fp16 holds every integer up to `2048`; bf16 holds `256` but not `2047`, so bf16 paths take
  `8`-bit slices.
* A CDNA 3 group of eight `11`-bit products can exceed `2^24`: seven products `2047²` total
  `29331463`, which the final RNE returns as `29331464` (the Tensor Core model, which truncates,
  returns `29331462`). With `11`-bit slices a CDNA 3 group must carry at most four nonzero products.
* The fp16 paths keep a group exact before one rounding, unlike the binary32 SFMA, which rounds
  after every product, as the Z3 models' engine does: products `5 × 2047², 1, −2 × 2047²` give the
  exact `12570628` on CDNA 1, 2 and 3 fp16, and `12570626` on the SFMA. The budget is a sufficient
  condition, not a necessary one. -/
