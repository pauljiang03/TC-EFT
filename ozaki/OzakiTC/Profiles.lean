/-! # The eight GPU paths

Exact Ozaki engines on every Tensor Core path of `TensorCore`. The slice width is set by what the
operand format holds: `b = 11` for fp16 and tf32 (`2^11 = 2048` and every smaller integer are
exact), `b = 8` for bf16. Every path has `F ≥ 23` and `2b ≤ F`.

| path | `K` | `F` | `b` |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| V100 fp16 | 4 | 23 | 11 |
| A100 fp16 | 8 | 24 | 11 |
| A100 bf16 | 8 | 24 | 8 |
| A100 tf32 | 4 | 24 | 11 |
| H100 fp16 | 16 | 25 | 11 |
| H100 bf16 | 16 | 25 | 8 |
| H100 tf32 (wmma) | 4 | 25 | 11 |
| H100 tf32 (mma) | 8 | 25 | 11 |

The budget `Σ|aᵢbᵢ| ≤ 2^24` is the same on every path: it is set by the binary32 output. For
`11`-bit slices it allows inner dimension `k ≤ 4`, a single V100 block; the A100 and H100 fp16
paths take groups of 8 and 16, whose products can exceed it (`OzakiTC.Limits`). -/
