/-! # Choosing the slice width, chunk length and passes per Tensor Core path

Ozaki-I on a Tensor Core path has three knobs, each exact by a theorem of this development:

* the **slice width** `b`: at most what the operand format holds (`11` for fp16 and tf32, `8` for
  bf16) and `2b ≤ F`;
* the **chunk length** of split-K, `m = 2^(24 − 2b)` products per exact call (`tcSplitK`,
  `tcSplitK_exactOn`): four for `11`-bit slices, sixteen for `10`-bit, `256` for `8`-bit; a chunk
  longer than the group `K` runs as chained groups;
* **one or two passes**: the two-pass engine runs every group twice (`c = 0`, then `c = −D1`) and
  is exact on full groups when `K · 2^(2b) ≤ 2^(F+1)` (`tcEngine2_exactOn`).

`candidates p bmax` lists every configuration these theorems make exact on path `p`
(`candidates_exact`). `SliceRun.blocks K k` counts the Tensor Core blocks (one group of `K`
products, one evaluation of the block model) a slice product of inner dimension `k` takes:
`⌈m / K⌉` per chunk of split-K, two per group for two passes. A partly filled group costs a whole
block, as a matrix instruction computes `K` products whatever their values.

**The slice rule.** For a target of `t` bits, `slicesFor b t` is the least `s` with
`(s + 1) 2^(t+2) ≤ 2^(s(b+1))`. This makes the slicing term of Ozaki-I's error bound,
`(s + 1) k 2^(E+F−s(b+1))` (`tcOzaki1L_error`), at most `2^-t · k · max|x| · max|y|`
(`slicing_term_le_maxAbs`): `t = 24` for a binary32-level result, `t = 53` for FP64. The Ozaki-I
triangle then has `s(s+1)/2` slice products, and the cost of a configuration is
`s(s+1)/2 · blocks`. For the exact path of correctly rounded FP64 (`smax (b+1) > 2098`, all `s²`
products) the worst case is `exactPathCost`.

**The cost is in model blocks, not measured time.** It counts matrix-instruction groups; it ignores
the integer work off the engine (slicing, adding chunk results), memory traffic, and the fact that
a real kernel runs many output entries per instruction.

## Results (inner dimension `k = 1024`)

| path | `K` | `F` | FP64 (`t = 53`): best | blocks | `b = 11`, split-K | `b = 11`, two passes | binary32 (`t = 24`): best | blocks |

| V100 fp16 | 4 | 23 | `b = 11`, split-K | 3840 | 3840 | 7680 | `b = 11`, split-K | 1536 |
| A100 fp16 | 8 | 24 | `b = 10`, split-K | 2688 | 3840 | 3840 | `b = 10`, split-K | 768 |
| A100 bf16 | 8 | 24 | `b = 8`, split-K | 3584 | — | — | `b = 8`, split-K | 1280 |
| A100 tf32 | 4 | 24 | `b = 11`, split-K | 3840 | 3840 | 7680 | `b = 11`, split-K | 1536 |
| H100 fp16 | 16 | 25 | `b = 10`, split-K | 1344 | 3840 | 1920 | `b = 10`, split-K | 384 |
| H100 bf16 | 16 | 25 | `b = 8`, split-K | 1792 | — | — | `b = 8`, split-K | 640 |
| H100 tf32 (wmma) | 4 | 25 | `b = 11`, split-K | 3840 | 3840 | 7680 | `b = 11`, split-K | 1536 |
| H100 tf32 (mma) | 8 | 25 | `b = 10`, split-K | 2688 | 3840 | 3840 | `b = 10`, split-K | 768 |

FP64 needs `5` slices of `11` bits (`15` products) or `6` of `10` bits (`21` products); binary32
needs `3` of either (`6` products). Where `K > 4`, narrower slices with longer chunks win: `10`-bit
slices fill a whole A100 or H100 group (`16 · 2^20 = 2^24`), so one block carries `16` products
instead of `4`. On H100 fp16 this costs `1344` blocks for FP64, against `3840` for `11`-bit slices
with chunks of four and `1920` with two passes; for binary32, `384` against `1536` and `768`. Under
this cost the two-pass engine never wins: whenever two passes make a full group of `11`-bit
products exact, `10`-bit slices make it exact in one pass, and the extra slice costs less than the
second pass. Where `K = 4` (V100 fp16, the tf32 `wmma` paths) a group holds only four products
whatever the width, so `11`-bit slices are best. The worst-case exact path follows the same pattern
(`h100F16_exactPath`). -/
