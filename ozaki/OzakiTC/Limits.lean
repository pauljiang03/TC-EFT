/-! # Where the conditions bind

Kernel-checked evaluations of the Tensor Core model that show each condition of the exactness
theorems at work, and how the model differs from the Z3 models' engine (binary32 additions with
round to nearest). Operand words are fp16: `0x6800 = 2048`, `0x67FF = 2047`, `0x6BFF = 4094`,
`0x3C00 = 1`, `0xE7FF = −2047`.

* fp16 holds every integer up to `2048` but not `4095`: slices of more than `11` bits cannot be
  encoded (the Z3 model's mutation check `[S1.11]`).
* The extreme `11`-bit block, four products `2048 · 2048 = 2^22`, totals exactly `2^24` and is
  returned exactly on V100.
* With `12`-bit magnitudes the budget is exceeded: `4094² + 2047² = 20951045` is not a binary32
  number and V100 returns `20951044` (the Z3 sanity query `[Z.5]`).
* A full A100 group of eight `11`-bit products can exceed `2^24`: seven products `2047²` total
  `29331463`, returned as `29331462`. With `11`-bit slices an A100 or H100 group must carry at most
  four nonzero products, or the slices must be `10`-bit.
* The Tensor Core accumulates a group exactly before one final rounding, unlike binary32
  additions: products `5 × 2047², 1, −2 × 2047²` give the exact `12570628` on A100, and
  `12570626` with binary32 additions in order. The budget is a sufficient condition for the
  hardware, not a necessary one. -/
