/-! # Exact-zero results without the exact path on CDNA 3

The same disjoint-support row and column as on the Tensor Core (`x = [3, 0, 2^-30, 0]`,
`y = [0, 5, 0, −7 · 2^40]`), on CDNA 3 fp16 blocks with split-K: the normwise check falls back to the
exact path (a sentinel exact path is returned), the check with the overlap count returns `0` from
the first slice count, in rational and bounded integer form, and with signed zeros `−0` exactly when
every product is `−0`. The binary64 oracle cases still come out as the oracle's values. -/
