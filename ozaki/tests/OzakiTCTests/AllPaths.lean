/-! # The Z3 models' test matrices on every Tensor Core path

`Z3Matrices` checks the V100 path. Here the same `4 × 4` cases run on the other seven paths of
`TensorCore`:

* the A100 and H100 fp16 paths and the three tf32 paths hold `11`-bit slices, so both schemes in
  the Z3 configuration return exactly the Z3 models' binary32 words. With `k = 4` every block
  carries at most four nonzero products, within the budget even where a group takes eight or
  sixteen;
* the bf16 paths cannot hold `11`-bit slices (bf16 has eight significant bits), so the Z3
  configuration returns `none`. With `8`-bit slices, and for Ozaki-II moduli at most `2^9`, they
  return the same result as an exact engine.

Each check is a kernel evaluation of the same definitions the theorems use. -/

/-! ## The bf16 paths

The Z3 configuration needs `11`-bit slices and residues up to `2048`, which bf16 cannot hold. With
`8`-bit slices and the moduli `{512, 511, 509, 503}` (`M ≈ 2^35.9`, so `P = 16`), every engine
call is exact and the result is that of an exact engine. -/
