/-! # The cheapest configurations on the oracle cases

The binary64 cases of [`data/correct-reference.json`](../../data/correct-reference.json) through
correctly rounded FP64 Ozaki-I with the configuration `OzakiTC.SplitChoice` picks for the H100 and
A100 fp16 paths: `10`-bit slices, split-K in chunks of sixteen (one full H100 group, two chained
A100 groups), five then six slices, then the exact path at up to `191` slices. Each returns the
exact-fraction oracle's words. -/
