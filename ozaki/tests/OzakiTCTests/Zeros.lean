/-! # Exact-zero results without the exact path

A row and a column with disjoint supports (`x = [3, 0, 2^-30, 0]`, `y = [0, 5, 0, −7 · 2^40]`, binary64
values): every product is zero, but `x` and `y` are not. On V100 fp16 blocks with split-K:

* the normwise check never settles it, so the entry goes to the exact path: with a sentinel in
  place of the exact path, the normwise scheme returns the sentinel;
* the check with the overlap count settles it on the first slice count: with the same sentinel,
  the scheme returns `0`; the bounded integer check does too;
* with signed zeros, the result is `−0` when every product is `−0` and `+0` otherwise, again from the
  first check.

The binary64 oracle cases still come out as the oracle's words, with the window check and in
bounded registers. -/

/-! Signed zeros: `3 · (−0)` and `(−0) · 5` are both `−0`, so the sum is `−0`; with `+0` in place of
the second `−0` one product is `+0`, and the sum is `+0`. Both from the first check, with a sentinel
exact path. -/
