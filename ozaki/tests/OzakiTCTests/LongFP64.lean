/-! # FP64 emulation and long dot products on the Tensor Core model

The binary64 cases of [`data/correct-reference.json`](../../data/correct-reference.json) (random
`4 × 8` by `8 × 4` binary64 products, exponents within `4` and `40` binades), against the words the
exact-fraction oracle computes. With `k = 8` and `11`-bit slices the engine needs split-K (chunks of
four), so these checks exercise `tcSplitK` as well:

* `tcOzaki1CRD`: correctly rounded FP64 by Ozaki-I on V100 fp16 blocks, five then six slices, then
  the exact path on V100 blocks;
* `tcOzaki2CRD`: the same by Ozaki-II with twelve moduli at most `4096` (`P = 69` for `k = 8`);
* `tcOzaki1D`: FP64 emulation by Ozaki-I with binary64 recombination and six slices, within its
  proved bound of the exact product (checked here by exact rational arithmetic). -/
