/-! # Exact-zero results without the exact path

The check of correctly rounded Ozaki-I uses the slicing bound `B = (s + 1) k 2^(E + F − s(b+1))`
(`ozaki1Bound`). When every product `xᵢ yᵢ` is zero but `x` and `y` are not, as for sparse rows and
columns with disjoint supports, the slice products add up to `H = 0` while `B > 0`, so `H ± B` round
to different values and the entry always takes the exact path.

The slicing error comes only from indices where both entries are nonzero: a slice coefficient or a
residual of `x` vanishes wherever `x` does (`split_vanishes`), and likewise for `y`. So `k` in the
bound can be replaced by the **overlap count** `N = #{i : xᵢ ≠ 0 ∧ yᵢ ≠ 0}`
(`exactTerms_error_overlap`):

  `|x · y − H| ≤ (s + 1) N 2^(E + F − s(b+1))`.

`N` is the integer dot product of the `0`/`1` support indicators of `x` and `y`, which every exact
engine computes exactly (`overlapEng_eq`): one extra dot product per output entry (for a GEMM, one
extra product of `0`/`1` matrices), whatever the slice count. The bound is never larger than the
normwise one (`N ≤ k`, `supportOverlap_le_length`), equals it on dense data, and is `0` exactly when every
product is zero (`supportOverlap_eq_zero_iff`). With a window accumulator the window's loss is charged only
to the nonzero slice products (`windowSum_error_nonzero`).

* `ozaki1CREZ`, `ozaki1CRWZ`: correctly rounded Ozaki-I with the overlap bound, with the exact sum
  or a `W`-bit window, exact path on the engine (`ozaki1CREZ_eq`, `ozaki1CRWZ_eq`);
* **exact zeros settle**: when every product is zero the first check returns `0`, whatever the
  exact path would return (`ozaki1CREZ_zero`, `ozaki1CRWZ_zero`);
* `ozaki1CRBZ`: the same in bounded integer registers (`ozaki1CheckBZ_eq`, `ozaki1CRBZ_eq`);
* `ozaki1CRWSZ`: with IEEE signed zeros (`ozaki1CRWSZ_eq`); an entry whose products are all zero
  gets the sign `crSigned` specifies without the exact path (`ozaki1CRWSZ_zero`). -/
