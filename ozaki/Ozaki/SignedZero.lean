/-! # Signed zeros

Values are rationals, which have one zero; IEEE formats have two. For a correctly rounded dot
product the sign of a zero result is fixed by IEEE's rules for multiplication and for a sum rounded
to nearest:

* a result that rounds to zero from a nonzero exact sum keeps the exact sum's sign (underflow);
* an exact sum of zero is `−0` only when every product is `−0`, the sign of a product being the
  exclusive or of its factors' signs, zeros included; otherwise it is `+0`.

`Signed` pairs a value with its sign bit, and `crSigned` is this specification: the round to
nearest of the exact sum, with the sign above. The enclosure check settles the sign as well when
the enclosure lies on one side of zero (`signFromEnclosure`), and the exact path knows it outright;
`certifySigned_eq` proves the signed check returns `crSigned`. `ozaki1CRWS` is the correctly
rounded Ozaki-I with a window accumulator and signed zeros (`ozaki1CRWS_eq`). -/
