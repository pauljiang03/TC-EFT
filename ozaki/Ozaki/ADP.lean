/-! # ADP and ESC: Ozaki-I on INT8 engines

NVIDIA's guaranteed-accuracy DGEMM (Schwarz et al., *Guaranteed DGEMM Accuracy While Using
Reduced Precision Tensor Cores Through Extensions of the Ozaki Scheme*, arXiv:2511.13778, modelled
in Z3 in `ozaki-NVIDIA/` of the Z3 repository) emulates binary64 GEMM on INT8 engines. Each row of
`A` (column of `B`) is converted to a `W`-bit fixed-point integer, cut into `s` signed 8-bit
slices, and all `s²` slice products are accumulated exactly. This file formalizes the parts that
do not depend on the engine:

* **Unsigned slice encoding (§3).** `remap s N` cuts `N` into `s` base-256 digits, lowest first,
  turning an unsigned digit `u ∈ [128, 255]` into `u − 256` with a carry. The digits always
  reconstruct `N` (`remap_value`); all are signed bytes exactly on
  `[−128 (256^s − 1)/255, 127 (256^s − 1)/255]` (`remap_s8`, `[Z.3]`); a remapped digit has the
  bit pattern of the unsigned one (`remap_bit_pattern`, `[Z.5]`); and the range is slightly smaller
  than the unsigned prototype's `[−2^(8s−1), 2^(8s−1))` (`remap_range_smaller`, `[Z.4]`).
* **Slice counts.** `53`-bit integers need `8` naive signed slices but `7` remapped ones
  (`slices_53`).
* **Exponent span capacity (§4).** The coarsened estimate of the largest product exponent never
  exceeds the exact one when zeros have exponent `−∞` (`coarseEst_le`, the paper's coarsening
  theorem, `[Z.6]`); skipping zeros or giving them exponent `−1022` is unsafe
  (`skipZeros_unsafe`, `field0_unsafe`, `[Z.7]`, `[Z.8]`).
* **Fidelity and funnel.** With `W = 53 + ESC + 1` the dominant products keep every bit
  (`full_fidelity`, `[Z.9]`, which also holds without the `+1`, `[Z.9b]`); each product's
  conversion error is at most `δa|b| + |ã|δb` (`term_error`, `[Z.10]`), and with the `+1` each half
  is at most `2^(F−52)` (`funnel`, `[Z.11]`), which fails without it (`funnel_needs_plus_one`,
  `[Z.12]`).
* **Recombination.** The `s²` slice products, weighted by `256^(t+u)`, add up to the product of
  the fixed-point integers (`slice_recombination`, `[R.1]`). -/

/-! ## Fidelity and the funnel -/

/-- **Full fidelity** (`[Z.9]`). With `W = 53 + ESC + 1`, the lowest bit `2^(e−52)` of every
entry that forms a dominant product lies on the fixed-point grid `2^(e_p + 1 − W)` of its row. -/
theorem full_fidelity (ep eq ex ey F ESC W : ℤ) (h1 : ex ≤ ep) (h2 : ey ≤ eq) (hF : F = ex + ey)
    (hE : ep + eq - F ≤ ESC) (hW : W = 53 + ESC + 1) :
    ep + 1 - W ≤ ex - 52 ∧ eq + 1 - W ≤ ey - 52 := by omega

/-- Full fidelity already holds with `W = 53 + ESC` (`[Z.9b]`). -/
theorem full_fidelity_without_plus_one (ep eq ex ey F ESC W : ℤ) (h1 : ex ≤ ep) (h2 : ey ≤ eq)
    (hF : F = ex + ey) (hE : ep + eq - F ≤ ESC) (hW : W = 53 + ESC) :
    ep + 1 - W ≤ ex - 52 ∧ eq + 1 - W ≤ ey - 52 := by omega

/-- **Term error** (`[Z.10]`): `|ab − ãb̃| ≤ δa |b| + |ã| δb`. -/
theorem term_error (a at_ b bt da db : ℚ) (ha : Rat.abs (a - at_) ≤ da) (hb : Rat.abs (b - bt) ≤ db) :
    Rat.abs (a * b - at_ * bt) ≤ da * Rat.abs b + Rat.abs at_ * db := by

  grind

/-- **The funnel** (`[Z.11]`). With `W = 54 + ESC`, both halves of a term's error,
`δa |b| ≤ 2^(e_p+1−W) 2^(e_b+1)` and `|ã| δb ≤ 2^(e_a+1) 2^(e_q+1−W)`, are at most `2^(F − 52)` for
every term (the Z3 query also assumes `e_a + e_b ≤ F`, which is not needed). -/
theorem funnel (ep eq ea eb F ESC W : ℤ) (h1 : ea ≤ ep) (h2 : eb ≤ eq)
    (hE : ep + eq - F ≤ ESC) (hW : W = 54 + ESC) :
    (ep + 1 - W) + (eb + 1) ≤ F - 52 ∧ (ea + 1) + (eq + 1 - W) ≤ F - 52 := by omega

/-- Without the `+1` the funnel bound fails (`[Z.12]`): `e_a = e_p = 0`, `e_b = e_q = 0`, `F = 0`,
`ESC = 0`, `W = 53`. -/
