/-! # The Ozaki schemes on the NVIDIA Tensor Core model

The engine of the `Ozaki` library built from the block model of `TensorCore`, its exactness on
every supported GPU path, the binary32 σ-trick, Ozaki-I and Ozaki-II with binary32
recombination, and Ozaki-I on an INT8 engine modelled by the fixed-width register (ADP). Every
working-precision rounding is IEEE's round to nearest even (`round32Value`, `fp64Round`);
TensorCore's own rounding computes the same value up to the largest finite value. -/
