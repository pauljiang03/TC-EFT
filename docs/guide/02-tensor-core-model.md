# The tensor-core block model

The model evaluates K exact products plus an FP32 accumulator input C. Each named architecture profile specifies K, extra alignment bits p, an optional alignment floor, and an input format: FP16, BF16, or packed TF32. All profiles in this chapter use FP32 output.

## Follow one block

| Stage | Executable definitions | Mathematical role |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Decode | `prepare`, `prepareProducts`, `Profile.decode` | Decode finite words and preserve unnormalized exponent/mantissa metadata |
| Multiply | `unnormalizedMul`, `PreparedBlock.terms` | Form exact products without normalizing their unnormalized exponent sums |
| Select grid | `PreparedBlock.alignExp`, `alignGridExponent` | Take the nonzero unnormalized-exponent maximum, apply the profile floor, and subtract alignment precision |
| Align | `truncCoeff`, `PreparedBlock.coefficients` | Truncate signed terms toward zero onto the common grid |
| Accumulate | `PreparedBlock.accumulator` | Sum retained integer coefficients exactly |
| Normalize and round | `evalPrepared`, `round32 .towardZero` | Normalize the exact accumulator and truncate it to finite FP32 |
| Explain loss | `alignmentResiduals`, `BlockTrace.residual` | Account for alignment loss and final-rounding loss |

Start with [Block.lean](../../TensorCore/TC/Block.lean), then follow [StageResiduals.lean](../../TensorCore/TC/StageResiduals.lean) and [ErrorBounds.lean](../../TensorCore/TC/ErrorBounds.lean). The [independent specification](../../TensorCore/TC/Specification/Defs.lean) uses separate mathematical definitions; its bridge proves equality of encoded results.

The unnormalized exponent matters even when two factorizations have the same product value. Replacing exact unnormalized products with normalized products can change the alignment grid and the answer. Zero terms do not choose the maximum unnormalized exponent; nonzero subnormal inputs retain their format's raw subnormal scale.

For FP32 output, alignment precision is `F = 23 + p`. The selected profiles are:

| Path | K | p | Floor |
| --- | ---: | ---: | ---: |
| V100 FP16 | 4 | 0 | none |
| A100 FP16 / BF16 | 8 | 1 | -132 |
| H100 FP16 / BF16 | 16 | 2 | -133 |
| A100 TF32 | 4 | 1 | -132 |
| H100 TF32 WMMA | 4 | 2 | -133 |
| H100 TF32 MMA | 8 | 2 | -133 |

The generic profile constructors also permit other K/p/floor parameters. The profile contract states its width, range, and format premises explicitly; choosing a parameter does not establish physical GPU correspondence.

## Read the contracts

```lean
import TensorCore.TC

open TensorCore

#check evalBlock_success_iff
#check profile_contract
#check evalBlock_machinePrefix
#check evalBlock_error_bound
#check IndependentSpec.supported_eq_spec
```

`evalBlock_success_iff` characterizes the accepted input domain. `profile_contract` states arithmetic and accumulator-width guarantees under explicit hypotheses. `evalBlock_machinePrefix` relates fixed-width accumulation to exact accumulation when the capacity assumptions hold. `evalBlock_error_bound` accounts for alignment loss and final rounding to FP32 loss. For every encoded input of a supported path, `supported_eq_spec` proves that the evaluator and independent specification agree on the output or rejection.

The finite model rejects nonfinite operands, wrong group sizes, and exact accumulators larger in magnitude than `maxFinite32`. Exact zero is canonicalized to +0; negative nonzero underflow may produce -0. The `tc_features` interface accepts TF32 register words with thirteen zero low bits; the paper EFT interface accepts packed 19-bit TF32 words.

[CanonicalInvocation.lean](../../examples/CanonicalInvocation.lean) combines a concrete Hopper calculation with a theorem relating fixed-width and exact accumulation. Hardware checks compare the software model's outputs with recorded GPU measurements.
