# TC-EFT: extraction and correction

EFT extraction takes encoded operands and any finite supplied FP32 word D. It reconstructs the exact input sum and corrects D without rerunning the TC model or assuming that D is the model's output.

## Follow the overlap identity

For exact terms Tᵢ, choose the extraction grid as the coarser of the alignment grid and D's FP32 grid. Split each term into a coarse part hᵢ and a low part εᵢ. Let H be the sum of coarse parts and εₒ = D - H. Then:

```text
S = D - εₒ + Σ εᵢ = H + Σ εᵢ
```

[Extraction.lean](../../TensorCore/EFT/Extraction.lean) proves this identity and the guarded scalar procedure. [ExtractionGrid.lean](../../TensorCore/EFT/ExtractionGrid.lean) gives the chosen-grid and input-budget results.

The scalar procedure sequentially adds the low parts in FP32, computes D - εₒ in FP32, and performs one final nearest-even addition. Its sufficient predicate checks that the low bits of all terms fit together within 24 bits (counted from the lowest low bit present), that this lowest bit is between `2^-149` and `2^104`, that D, εₒ and H each fit in FP32's 24 significant bits, and that the final sum is within finite FP32 range. These premises justify exact intermediate operations. A failed predicate makes the scalar helper return `none`.

The common grid is the lowest bit actually set in the low parts (zeros ignored), the same rule as the TC-EFT paper's generator and the 576-bit implementation; it is the tightest grid for this check. The chosen-grid theorems also cover other valid common grids; identifiers beginning `inputBudget_` concern the TC-EFT paper's input-budget inequality (17).

## Execute a correction

```lean
import TensorCore.EFT.Encoded

open TensorCore

def tiny : BlockInput v100F16F32 :=
  ⟨List.replicate 4 (0x0c00, 0x0c00), 0x3f800000⟩

#eval (tcEftEncoded tiny 0x3f800000).map fun r => r.bits.map BitVec.toNat

example : tcEftEncoded tiny 0x3f800000 =
    .ok (.consolidated (.scalar 0x3f800002)) := by decide +kernel
```

The supplied D is FP32 `1.0`. Each exact product is `2^-24`, so the exact input sum is `1 + 2^-22`. The calculation succeeds with the decoded FP32 value `1.0000002384185791015625`. It prints the encoded result inside `Except.ok (some ...)`; the proof checks both its exact bit pattern and the scalar branch tag.

## Reference and bounded execution

| Layer | Entry point | Consolidation |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Reference | `tcEftEncoded` | Guarded FP32 scalar branch, otherwise exact-rational consolidation and one RNE rounding |
| Bounded | `EFMachine.tcEft` | Fixed 576-bit workspace, guarded FP32 scalar branch, otherwise bounded exact consolidation |
| Native scalar refinement | `EFMachine.tcEftWithLean` | Same bounded algorithm with Lean native FP32 scalar additions |
| Independent FloatLib | `TCFloat.Interface.eftChecked` | FloatLib scalar operations and reference exact fallback |

`EFMachine.tcEft_agrees` preserves the returned bits of the reference algorithm under its premises. `EFMachine.Components.scalar_of_guard` proves that the bounded fast path, plain FP32 operations, returns the correctly rounded sum whenever its check passes. The bounded and reference fallback branch names may differ. `tcEftWithLean_eq` preserves the entire bounded result, including tags and errors. FloatLib's `floatlib_eq_reference` preserves the complete checked reference TC/EFT observations for every encoded input in its profile family.

```lean
import TensorCore.EFT
import TensorCore.Kernels.EFT

open TensorCore

```

[BoundedEFT.lean](../../examples/BoundedEFT.lean) runs a BF16 cancellation case with a supplied D unrelated to the exact ideal, then applies the universal success contract. [ScalarEFT.lean](../../examples/ScalarEFT.lean) shows correction with FP64 intermediates and a final FP32 output.
