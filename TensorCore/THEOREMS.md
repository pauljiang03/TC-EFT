# What is proved

This page lists the main results that Lean has checked, in plain language. Each row says what the
result means. The linked file has the exact statement and every assumption. All results depend
only on Lean's standard axioms (`propext`, `Classical.choice`, `Quot.sound`).

Two papers are cited in docstrings: *Accurate Models* (Khattak and Mikaitis, arXiv 2512.07004v4)
for the Tensor Core model, and *the TC-EFT paper* for non-monotonicity and the TC-EFT algorithm.

## The Tensor Core model

| What it says | Lean name | File |
| --- | --- | --- |
| The model and an independently written transcription of *Accurate Models* give the same output bits, or both reject, for every input on all 8 supported GPU paths. | `IndependentSpec.supported_eq_spec` | [TC/Specification/Supported.lean](TC/Specification/Supported.lean) |
| The model accepts an input exactly when it has the right number of products, no NaN or infinity, and a sum that fits in FP32. | `evalBlock_success_iff` | [TC/AcceptedDomain.lean](TC/AcceptedDomain.lean) |
| The exact sum of the inputs equals the output plus everything lost to alignment and rounding. | `evalBlock_residual_identity` | [TC/StageResiduals.lean](TC/StageResiduals.lean) |
| The error is less than (number of terms) × (alignment grid step) + (one output ulp). | `evalBlock_error_bound` | [TC/ErrorBounds.lean](TC/ErrorBounds.lean) |
| A fixed-width wrapping accumulator gives the same output for every input when it is wide enough (29/31/33 bits for V100/A100/H100 FP16). | `evalBlockMachine_eq` | [TC/MachineRefinement.lean](TC/MachineRefinement.lean) |
| Every partial sum in that accumulator is exact, in any order. | `evalBlock_machinePrefix` | [TC/AlignmentExponent.lean](TC/AlignmentExponent.lean) |
| The guarantees above, bundled for any profile. | `profile_contract` | [TC/CanonicalFormats.lean](TC/CanonicalFormats.lean) |
| For chained groups, the loss accounting holds across the whole chain. | `runBlocks_residual_ledger` | [TC/Composition.lean](TC/Composition.lean) |

## Non-monotonicity

| What it says | Lean name | File |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Lowering C from 1 to the next FP32 value below raises the output exactly when the group has at least 3·2^p products (K equal products of `2^-(24+p)`; floor at most −1). | `nonmonotone_encoded` | [TC/Monotonicity.lean](TC/Monotonicity.lean) |
| For `C = 1 − j·2^-24`: exactly which j raise the output, the output formula, and its maximum. | `nonmonotone_range_encoded` | [TC/MonotonicityRange.lean](TC/MonotonicityRange.lean) |
| For any inputs, an output increase needs the recovered products to outweigh the change in C; this suffices when both sums are FP32-representable. | `flowback_necessary`, `flowback_sufficient` | [TC/Flowback.lean](TC/Flowback.lean) |

## TC-EFT correction

| What it says | Lean name | File |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Any result TC-EFT returns is the exact sum rounded to nearest-even FP32, for any finite D. | `tcEftEncoded_correct` | [EFT/Encoded.lean](EFT/Encoded.lean) |
| TC-EFT returns a result exactly when that rounded sum is finite. | `tcEftEncoded_bits_isSome_iff` | [EFT/Encoded.lean](EFT/Encoded.lean) |
| When the scalar safety check passes, the fast FP32 path gives the correctly rounded sum. | `scalarCorrected_correct` | [EFT/Extraction.lean](EFT/Extraction.lean) |
| Exact sum = D − overlap + low parts. True by construction, since the overlap is defined as D minus the retained part. | `overlap_recovery` | [EFT/Extraction.lean](EFT/Extraction.lean) |
| The input-budget inequality establishes two of the safety check's conditions; the other seven are assumed. | `ExtractionGrid.inputBudget_scalarPredicate` | [EFT/ExtractionGrid.lean](EFT/ExtractionGrid.lean) |
| The 576-bit implementation succeeds exactly when the rounded sum is finite, and never overflows. | `EFMachine.tcEft_success`, `EFMachine.tcEft_range_iff` | [Kernels/EFT/Correctness.lean](Kernels/EFT/Correctness.lean) |
| The 576-bit implementation returns the same bits as the reference algorithm. | `EFMachine.tcEft_agrees` | [Kernels/EFT/Refinement.lean](Kernels/EFT/Refinement.lean) |
| Using Lean's native `Float32` additions changes nothing (relative to Lean's `Float32` specification). | `EFMachine.tcEftWithLean_eq` | [Kernels/EFT/Native.lean](Kernels/EFT/Native.lean) |

## Number formats and rounding

| What it says | Lean name | File |
| --- | --- | --- |
| FP32 conversion returns the nearest value, ties to even, for every in-range input. | `round32_nearestEven_correct` | [Numerics/CorrectRounding.lean](Numerics/CorrectRounding.lean) |
| The same holds for any binary format and rounding direction. | `roundBinary_correct` | [Numerics/Binary/RoundingContract.lean](Numerics/Binary/RoundingContract.lean) |
| Conversion succeeds exactly when the input is within the format's finite range. | `roundBinary_isSome_iff` | [Numerics/Binary/RoundingContract.lean](Numerics/Binary/RoundingContract.lean) |
| Finite bit patterns and representable values correspond one to one, including subnormals and both zeros. | `signedFiniteBinaryBijection` | [Numerics/Binary/SignedBijection.lean](Numerics/Binary/SignedBijection.lean) |
| Naive floating-point summation is exact when the summands fit within a bounded bit span. | `naiveSumBinary_exact_of_bitSpan` | [Numerics/Binary/ScalarSum.lean](Numerics/Binary/ScalarSum.lean) |

## Not proved

- That real GPUs behave like the model. That is tested by replaying recorded GPU outputs.
- That the fast path is taken whenever the safety check passes. The 576-bit implementation checks
  this at run time.

The [FloatLib correspondence](../floatlib-port/COMPARISON.md) covers the independent second
implementation. This block keeps every name above connected to the actual API:
